covering the back and "],["146.4","uh that was a cause that we ourselves "],["148.48","were committed to "],["150.44","and uh actually had met on the mission "],["152.319","field ourselves and wanted to continue "],["155.4","uh being involved "],["157.2","in uh the problem however with with "],["159.879","causes like that is that there's often "],["163.879","setbacks uh just like elections you

be fully "],["178.12","realized as far as you can "],["180.92","tell so we're going to look at uh this "],["183.56","Old Testament book of First Kings we're "],["185.72","going to look at a cause fighter uh who "],["189.28","was uh having that kind of uh situation "],["192.799","in his own uh life and Ministry so a "],["195.799","servant of God whom God used to uh bring "],["199.2","the nation of Israel face to face with "],["202.08","their uh idolatry with their "],["205.28","unfaithfulness with their departure from "],["207.44","the "],["208.56","Lord uh chapter 18 if you remember tells "],["211.92","the incredible story of uh how Elijah "],["215.12","challenged the the prophets of Baal that "],["218.28","was the the false god of uh one one of "],["221.2","the surrounding Nations uh on the on the "],["224.56","top of Mount "],["226.68","Caramel uh brought back rain from the "],["229.72","earth or onto the Earth after three and "],["232.04","a half years of "],["233.68","drought so that that was a a huge "],["236.4","Victory great victory for the Lord and "],["238.28","his people uh the people actually "],["240.64","acknowledge the Lord he is God uh and "],["244.079","they recognize that he uh was Superior "],["247.439","to that false god of "],["251.04","Baal and yet if you keep reading and "],["253.879","this is one of the things about "],["255.959","scripture it's it's so transparent and "],["260.4","uh "],["261.24","raw uh so it tells us the truth it "],["264.4","presents God's servants warts and all "],["268.08","and uh something that we can relate to "],["270.72","here in uh 2024 uh chapter 19 we find "],["275.88","Elijah running for his "],["278.44","life and uh he's in Despair and uh about "],["283.44","ready to throw it all throw it all in so "],["286.72","uh let's look at the story verse one of "],["288.68","chapter 19 of First Kings uh now Ahab "],["292.919","told Jezebel everything that Elijah had "],["295.96","done how he had killed the prophets "],["299.84","uh with the sword and so Jezebel the "],["303.32","queen sent a message to Elijah saying "],["307","May the gods deal with me and ever so "],["311","severely if by this time tomorrow I do "],["314.199","not make your life like the lives of "],["317.639","those you have "],["319.56","killed so Ahab the king he relays to his "],["323.199","wife uh the wicked Jezebel that all that "],["326.16","Elijah had done how he killed all of her "],["328.919","Prophets of baale with the sword uh "],["332.28","which to say the very least made her "],["334.72","very "],["335.88","angry uh she threatens to kill him by "],["339","that same time tomorrow and so in "],["342.4","instead of facing "],["344.36","down uh Jezebel challenging her "],["347.639","arrogance her insolence against God "],["350.68","Elijah turns tail and he runs for his "],["355.199","life in his mind one Queen was more "],["358.96","powerful and more deadly than the 450 "],["363.52","prophets of Baal that he had just "],["366.84","executed so Elijah had some success uh "],["370.12","earlier you know on the mount on Mount "],["372.199","Carmel but it wasn't total uh the fire "],["375.039","of God fell praise God the people "],["377.16","acknowledged that the Lord was "],["379.44","God but they didn't fully turn to the "],["382.88","Lord with all their hearts the country's "],["386.24","top leaders remained in power and they "],["390.96","stubbornly uh rebelled still against God "],["394.08","and his "],["395.919","commands Elijah was very "],["398.919","disappointed the con conflict didn't "],["401.44","turn out the way he had expected he felt "],["404.599","vulnerable he gave into "],["407.56","fear and how bad did it get well let's "],["411.52","find "],["412.72","out verse three Elijah was afraid and he "],["416.96","ran for his life when he came to beeba "],["419.319","and Judah he left his servant there "],["423.12","while he himself traveled on a Day's "],["425.08","Journey Into the "],["427.12","Wilderness he sat down under a broom "],["429.599","tree and prayed that he might "],["432.8","die I have had enough Lord he said take "],["436.68","my life for I no better than my "],["440.84","fathers and then he laid down under the "],["443.12","broom tree and he fell "],["446.68","asleep he told God I'm done "],["450.56","like Moses he felt he had nothing left "],["452.919","to offer God like Jonah things didn't "],["456.4","work out the way he planned he was "],["459.44","spent and so he decided it was better "],["462.319","for him to die than to "],["465.24","live notice though uh suicide wasn't an "],["468.52","option okay he wasn't going to take his "],["471.599","own life himself he preferred death to "],["474.52","life but uh that wasn't his place but "],["477.96","doesn't mean he can't pray for God to do "],["480.199","that right uh God alone gives life and "],["483.72","he alone can take it away he asked God "],["487.039","to put him out of his "],["489.599","misery so I wonder if some of us here "],["492.4","this morning are in that "],["494.4","situation maybe you're involved in in "],["497","Ministry or dealing with an issue and we "],["499.56","had some of those this morning as we "],["500.96","talked about during prayer time uh "],["503.52","situation through uh maybe no fault of "],["506.199","your own uh hasn't been resolved to your "],["509","s your "],["510.039","satisfaction uh that's one of my "],["512.399","personally pet peeves is things that "],["515.12","never get resolved you know unresolve "],["517.919","conflict and a lot of times it comes to "],["520","a head especially around the holidays "],["521.719","you know people that you can sort of "],["524.039","keep your safe distance from um but then "],["527.959","hey they're coming over for Thanksgiving "],["529.68","or we're going over there right so uh "],["532.32","those are things that are sometimes "],["536","unavoidable uh but maybe you're wanting "],["537.88","to escape uh maybe you're wanting to go "],["540.76","somewhere else somewhere else run from "],["542.92","the pain uh things aren't working out so "],["546.279","it's time to cut your losses and end it "],["551.079","all and yet in this story specifically "],["555","God was not done with his "],["557.48","servant God still had things for Elijah "],["560.88","to do uh but first things "],["564.36","first suddenly an angel touched him and "],["567.279","said get up and he "],["571.079","and he looked around and there by his "],["572.76","head was a cake of bread baked over hot "],["575.399","coals and a jar of "],["577.68","water so he ate and drank and lay down "],["582.48","again a second time the angel of the "],["585","Lord returned and touched him saying get "],["587.399","up and eat or the journey will be too "],["589.76","much for "],["591.2","you so he got up and ate and "],["594.68","drank and strengthened by that food he "],["597.6","walked 40 days "],["599.839","and 40 nights until he reached Horeb the "],["603","Mountain of "],["605.48","God Elijah was exhausted the encounter "],["609.16","on Mount Carmel had completely depleted "],["612.079","his strength and his physical "],["614.16","resources God formed our inward Parts he "],["617.72","covered us in our mother's wombs our "],["619.76","frames are not hidden from him David "],["623.079","said he knows what we need even before "],["625.68","we ask even before addressing his emot "],["629.32","emotional and phys and spiritual needs "],["632","God knew that Elijah needed food he "],["634.839","needed water he needed "],["637.04","sleep in the line of duty Elijah had "],["640.8","neglected these physical needs and God "],["643.8","sent an angel to provide these vital "],["645.92","Necessities for "],["647.88","him how good is our heavenly father that "],["652.88","he provides these things for his "],["654.32","children in our time of "],["656.72","need God strengthened his servant "],["660.24","and once he was back on his feet again "],["662.04","Elijah went as fast as possible to meet "],["667.2","God when you're not sure about what to "],["669.519","do or where to go when you're confused "],["671.519","about what to do next press into God's "],["675.079","presence for his guidance and his "],["679.6","Direction so there in Horeb Elijah "],["682.839","entered a cave and spent the "],["684.88","night and the word of the Lord came to "],["687.279","him saying what do you you doing here "],["691.92","Elijah I have been very zealous for the "],["694.48","Lord the god of hosts he replied but the "],["698.16","Israelites have forsaken your Covenant "],["701.079","they've torn down your altars they've "],["702.76","killed your prophets with the "],["705","sword I'm the only one left and they are "],["708.399","seeking my life as "],["711.72","well God comes to Elijah and ask him "],["714.959","what is he doing you know what are you "],["716.76","doing here Elijah not of course that he "],["718.76","didn't know God never asks questions "],["720.6","that he doesn't know the answer "],["722.8","to uh but God knew his name he calls him "],["727.6","by name he knew where he "],["729.519","was he knew the circumstances that were "],["732.279","bearing down on Elijah he knew what "],["735.079","happened on Mount Carmel in the ensuing "],["737.32","Rage of Queen Jezebel in fact God "],["741.24","himself had directed the preceding "],["743.44","events on Mount Carmel for Elijah to "],["746.6","carry "],["747.56","out the showd between the Lord and Baal "],["751.279","have been orchestrated by "],["753.839","God see also God's mercy and God's "],["758.36","compassion he cares about his servant "],["761.6","not just the cause he calls Elijah by "],["765","name and he meets him where he is he "],["768.079","empathizes with his discouraged and "],["771.12","dejected "],["773.639","servant notice too that Elijah cared "],["777.68","about God's cause "],["780.72","Paul said of Timothy I have no one "],["782.76","likeminded who will sincerely care for "],["785.48","your state it's a rare thing and very "],["788.76","admirable that Elijah cared about God's "],["792.279","name and the advance of his glory in all "],["795","the Earth he wasn't just putting in his "],["798.36","time going through the motions and "],["800.8","checking out the end at the end of the "],["802.68","day he cared deeply that the children of "],["805.519","Israel thought highly of the "],["807.76","Lord and that they followed and obeyed "],["810.399","him fully from their "],["812.8","hearts he took God's cause to heart he "],["816.88","was very zealous he was all in for God "],["820.48","to the point of incurring the wrath of "],["822.519","Jezebel endangering his own "],["826.079","life was it a noble "],["829.399","cause was this cause worth spending his "],["832.56","life for with Stakes so high that it "],["834.72","could easily cost him "],["837.199","everything yes "],["839.959","thousand times "],["842.399","yes what cause are you fighting "],["845.32","for there's lots of voices that clamor "],["847.92","for our attention and our devotion many "],["850.36","movements and ideologies call for us to "],["853","spend ourselves and Advance their "],["855.72","agendas so be agenda it could be careers "],["859.839","could be status fame "],["863.959","money some are noble and good but many "],["867.6","are not "],["869.759","God calls us to follow his will and to "],["871.959","take up his cause give up your small "],["876.16","Ambitions seek first his kingdom and his "],["880.639","righteousness Jesus "],["882.519","said Elijah was also "],["885.519","isolated I am the only one left he had "],["889.279","no companion he had no Fellowship he was "],["891.72","all by "],["893.44","himself how important it is and here we "],["896.72","are this morning right in God's house uh "],["899.56","how important it is to be in God's house "],["901.8","I meet folks on a regular basis that uh "],["904.759","for whatever reason

"],["945.16","anywhere uh so that's why we regularly "],["948.399","immerse our minds in the scriptures we "],["950.44","renew our minds uh reminding ourselves "],["953.72","of what God's done in the

"],["335.919","that you can't admit to or come to terms "],["338.28","with then your relationship with God can "],["341.16","go no further like you have to "],["344.28","understand who you are in

"]]},{"id":"vgRbNMBB2j4","name":"2024-08-25  Guest Speaker - Daniel Jones","date":"2024-08-25","transcript":[["23.519","morning so it's always an interesting um "],["27.16","situation whenever Pastor mcnut asked me "],["29.279","to preach because it's always a one-off "],["31.679","thing generally it's much easier when "],["34","you preach in a series it's a lot harder "],["36.16","when someone's just like hey you want to "],["37.399","preach cuz it's like what do I talk "],["39.079","about there's the entirety of scripture "],["41.36","I can I have a lot of things going on in "],["43.12","my life I can talk about literally "],["44.32","anything generally whenever I am in "],["47.32","those situations I try to think what is "],["48.96","God teaching me and for some reason I "],["52","mean not that God isn't teaching me "],["53.28","things but there's nothing I can turn a "],["54.64","sermon into you know what I'm saying "],["56.359","like and then I'm driving home "],["61.039","with my wife and we start talking about "],["63.16","theological things which I'm sure many "],["64.839","of you do as well you know bless her "],["66.96","heart she she listens to me for this "],["68.96","stuff and we got on the subject of "],["71.52","communion and I started to realize I "],["73.68","like to think of myself as a relatively "],["75.159","educated "],["76.2","individual and I started to realize "],["78.28","there were things about communion that I "],["79.68","myself had never really even considered "],["82","so I went home and I studied it I fell "],["84.92","down the rabbit hole I came out the "],["86.88","other side and what I found convicted me "],["90.439","and impressed me so I found my "],["94.96","topic so today we are going to be "],["97.28","talking about communion and for those of "],["99.24","you that may have been here in previous "],["100.92","times that I've preached this is going "],["102.52","to be very different than my normal "],["103.92","sermon format because this is going to "],["105.719","be more academic in nature because "],["108.399","there's a lot to cover there's a lot to "],["109.96","talk about but my plan for this is that "],["113.439","you will grow a greater appreciation for "],["116.92","what communion is and for who and why we "],["120.399","do "],["121.32","it so our main passages today are going "],["124.719","to be out of 1 Corinthians 11: "],["127.2","23-26 we're also going to read Matthew "],["130.28","2623 and 26 or through 26 and so "],["134.92","starting with 1 "],["136.239","Corinthians starting at verse um 23 for "],["140.319","I received from the Lord that which I "],["141.8","also deliver to you that the Lord Jesus "],["144.12","on the same night that he was betrayed "],["145.72","took bread and when he had given thanks "],["147.72","he broke it and said take this is my "],["150.12","body which is broken for you do this in "],["152.4","remembrance of me in the same manner he "],["155.08","also took the cup after supper saying "],["157.76","this cup is the New Covenant in my blood "],["160.12","this do as often as you drink it in "],["161.959","remembrance of me for as often as you "],["164.159","eat this drink and drink bread sorry eat "],["167.08","this bread and drink this cup you "],["168.4","proclaim the Lord's death till he comes "],["171.12","and so if we jump over to "],["175.04","Matthew 26 and we start at verse 26 or h "],["180.239","hm start at verse "],["184.08","26 and as they were eating Jesus Took "],["186.56","bread and blessed and broke it he gave "],["188.519","it to the disciples and said take eat "],["190.4","this is my body then he took the cup and "],["193.04","gave thanks and gave it to them saying "],["194.68","drink from it all of you for this is my "],["196.959","blood of the New Covenant which is shed "],["199.319","for you for the remission of sins but I "],["201.799","say to you I will not drink of this "],["203.519","fruit of the vine from now on until the "],["205.56","day when I drink it new with you in my "],["207.56","father's Kingdom "],["210.439","so between those two segments and there "],["213.76","are more by the way you can also look in "],["215.64","Mark "],["217.68","14 you can also look in Mark 141 12-26 "],["221.36","and Luke 221 "],["223.28","14-23 what we find though is that the "],["225.4","structure Remains the Same Jesus gives "],["228.68","thanks breaks the bread shares the cup "],["232.76","while making the same statements and "],["235.48","then Matthew and Mark both refer to A "],["238.12","Hymn at the end of the feast um sorry "],["241.599","verse 30 in Matthew but when they s when "],["243.92","they and when they had sung the hymn "],["245.879","they went to the Mount of Olives so "],["247.959","overall we have a very consistent "],["249.319","account of what happened there with very "],["251.159","little uh variation between them now as "],["254.4","a result of these passages a number of "],["258.519","interpretations have Arisen throughout "],["260.44","the years and there are four primary "],["262.04","ones that have lasted throughout history "],["264.36","there is "],["265.8","transubstantiation "],["267.6","consubstantiation symbolic or zwinglian "],["271.039","reformed SL biblical and you got to love "],["274.96","the humility of the reformed theologians "],["277.56","that went yeah we got the biblical "],["279.639","one anyway so what do each of these "],["284.72","mean now "],["286.96","transubstantiation is primarily held by "],["289.199","the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox "],["291.08","Church um this holds a very literal "],["294.52","interpretation of scripture uh the word "],["297.44","means change of substance "],["300.68","and so it is believed that the elements "],["303.4","after they are blessed by the priest "],["305.12","literally become the blood and Body of "],["307.6","Christ and once it is blessed that is "],["310.24","the reason uh only priests are allowed "],["313.039","to handle it however um they also "],["317.4","believe that communion is uh that you "],["319.72","must keep taking communion in order to "],["321.6","continue in Grace that's why it's kind "],["323.8","of a big deal when the Catholic Church "],["325.56","refuses to give people communion you'll "],["328","hear about that sometimes in the news "],["329.36","the Church decided not to give this "],["330.6","person communion they're basically "],["332.44","saying no Grace for you which is kind of "],["335.44","a big deal um consubstantiation on the "],["339.72","other end or not other end but this held "],["342.4","viw is held mostly by lutherans in "],["344.52","recent years they've some Lutheran "],["346","Churches have started stepping away from "],["347.36","this but primarily you'll find this uh "],["349.88","in Lutheran Churches methodists also "],["352.84","might fall under this umbrella um I "],["356.199","contacted a friend of mine who's a a um "],["358.8","Pastor in the Methodist church cuz I "],["360.88","couldn't figure out what their website "],["362.039","said and he went well we call it the "],["363.96","Divine mystery which not trying to make "],["367.36","fun of them is a nice way of saying we "],["368.919","don't know and that's okay sometimes "],["372.12","when it comes to the Bible we don't know "],["375.039","because if we could understand "],["376.4","everything about God then God wouldn't "],["378","be worth worshiping right so some things "],["380.759","we may not understand and that's okay um "],["384.199","but this word means with substance it "],["387.96","proposes that it doesn't become the "],["390.639","literal body and blood of Christ at "],["393.4","least not externally but after "],["395.12","consumption it it does or like I said "],["398.199","there's that Divine mystery but somehow "],["400.36","this causes a connection with "],["402.84","Christ uh then there's the symbolic or "],["405.24","zwinglian view um this is the view "],["408.319","that's held most by those that followed "],["410.24","the anabaptist tradition so people like "],["412.68","Methodist non denominational generally "],["414.639","fall under this umbrella and the various "],["417.199","offshoots of modern Baptist "],["420.16","um this view holds exactly what it says "],["423.28","the bread and the cup are only that they "],["426.599","are the bread and the cup uh it's there "],["428.96","to serve as a reminder for what Jesus "],["430.759","has done can do and will do now reformed "],["434.599","SL "],["435.919","biblical the view is held by those who "],["438.759","come from the tradition that are laid "],["440.24","out by John Calvin so mainly "],["444.68","Presbyterians um but I have been told "],["446.919","that not all Presbyterian churches "],["448.599","ascribe to this "],["450.16","um and I'm going to be honest with you "],["451.84","this view confuses me like I've read it "],["455.24","from multiple time multiple times I've "],["456.879","read it from multiple sources and I "],["458.28","still don't get it but here it "],["460.319","goes they believe that the table is a "],["462.84","way of imparting Grace to us and "],["465.24","establishing a bond between Christ and "],["467.44","man um One Source I said is that it "],["470.479","forms it's a form of participating in "],["473.56","the coming age of Christ in a spiritual "],["477.52","sense I don't get it either so don't "],["480.039","feel bad "],["482.84","um "],["484.56","overall which of these views are "],["487.68","correct well if we at Faith Bible hold a "],["491.12","very literal interpretation of scripture "],["493.68","as we say we do then we should subscribe "],["496.12","to transubstantiation right that's the "],["498.4","one that seems like it makes the most "],["499.599","sense it's literal it's the blood and "],["500.84","Body of Christ well wait a "],["504.4","minute we also believe in what we what "],["507.08","Pastor mcnut likes to call someone say "],["508.639","it with me consistent biblical "],["512","hermeneutic come on that was like half "],["514.479","like two of you anyway consistent "],["517.08","biblical hermeneutic right and so that "],["520.12","means that we have to take in the "],["521.76","entirety of scripture in order to "],["523.519","understand things we can't just find one "],["525","verse and go yep that's it and run with "],["526.839","it we have to make sure that it fits "],["528.16","within the grand scheme of what God is "],["529.48","trying to say and so when we ask "],["531.959","ourselves about communion we have to "],["533.92","come back to the reality that Jesus is "],["536.399","taking an already existing symbol does "],["538.68","anybody know what symb symbol Jesus is "],["543.64","using they're celebrating the Feast "],["546.64","of Passover come on guys Passover right "],["550.72","and so he's taking a symbol that already "],["552.72","exists and he and his disciples are in "],["556","the process of celebrating "],["558.16","Passover and he's taking those symbols "],["560.68","to reveal a new meaning not even a new "],["563.36","meaning a meaning that has been behind "],["564.519","them the whole time and so Passover was "],["567.32","established back in Exodus 12 we're not "],["569.6","going to go there I don't have a whole "],["570.72","lot of time so we're going to to try to "],["571.88","get through this Exodus 12 with the 10th "],["574.959","plague of Egypt right and so this is the "],["577.72","plague of the firstborn when the "],["580.12","firstborn sons of e were going to die "],["582.72","unless they did what was told to them in "],["584.24","the Passover and if they did it "],["586.32","correctly the angel of death would pass "],["589.92","over and so that's where we get the name "],["591.76","for it in the first Passover the "],["594.24","requirements were uh you had to prepare "],["596.36","a lamb you had to completely consume "],["598.24","that lamb you had eat unleavened bread "],["601.279","which for those of you that may not know "],["602.959","cuz I didn't for the longest time uh "],["606.32","unleavened bread is bread that doesn't "],["608.12","rise because it doesn't have yeast in it "],["610.959","so um it's unleavened bread bitter herbs "],["614.68","and then they had to spread the blood of "],["616.04","the Lamb on the doorpost all while being "],["619.959","packed dressed and ready to leave "],["623","because the point was is God was taking "],["624.64","them out of Egypt so they had to be "],["625.92","ready to "],["627.36","depart after the events of of the first "],["630.2","Passover so after they left Egypt "],["632.56","Traditions started to emerge from it "],["634.72","that we don't find in the law "],["638.2","which Jesus was celebrating it so I'm "],["640.48","not going to complain about it but it's "],["642.279","not found in the law they added "],["643.56","Traditions to it um so the Passover that "],["646.36","Jesus observed was similar in essence "],["649.16","but it was executed differently so in "],["651.839","Exodus 12 as I said the Passover "],["653.6","included lamb unleavened bread bitter "],["655.2","herbs by the time Jesus had come around "],["657.639","it had grown to have at least three cups "],["660.36","of wine involved and now today in modern "],["664.24","times there's even more involved with it "],["667.079","and what they now refer to as the cedar "],["669.839","cedar translates to order and so it "],["672.639","refers to the order in which you eat the "],["675.16","elements um in the Cedar they now "],["677.839","include greens that are dipped in "],["679.56","saltwater a hard-boiled egg and the "],["682.959","fourth cup or a fourth cup the egg and "],["685.88","the fourth cup appeared after the "],["687.92","destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD so "],["690.519","Jesus wouldn't have had those at his um "],["693.639","however for our purposes today I will "],["696.56","focus on the four elements that I have "],["698.6","mentioned that we know we present with "],["700.639","Jesus um there "],["703.6","is so much of the last week of Jesus's "],["706.839","life that we could examine um that have "],["709.079","to do with the Passover feast and things "],["711.04","like that for example the same day that "],["713.68","Jesus rides into Jerusalem with his "],["715.399","triumphal entry and everybody's waving "],["717.04","the things Hosanna you know all that "],["718.56","kind of stuff is the and he enters the "],["720.68","temple that's the same day that you "],["722.92","picked your lamb and started preparing "],["725.36","it for "],["727.68","Passover "],["729.36","symbolism so anyway we're going to look "],["732.2","at the Last Supper though because we "],["733.399","could do spend a whole lot of time on "],["735.199","all this but we're going to look at the "],["736.24","Last Supper the first thing that Jesus "],["738.6","does in this is he gives thanks now "],["741.44","within the modern Cedar it is usually "],["743.72","said blessed are you oh Lord our god "],["746.56","king of the universe who creates the "],["748.44","fruit of the Vine "],["750.6","this is usually done during the "],["752.16","presentation of the first cup after the "],["754.56","first cup the bitter herbs are then "],["756.399","dipped and eaten followed by the lamb a "],["760.6","prayer is said "],["762.079","then or a prayer is said then the second "],["764.92","cup is taken during modern practices the "],["769.76","um youngest is now allowed to ask "],["772.399","questions about why are we doing this "],["774.639","what is what do the symbols mean what "],["776.04","are we supposed to learn from this um "],["779.24","after this the bread is broken and "],["781.6","that's where we get the statement this "],["782.76","is my body which is broken for you we "],["785.72","can observe this in the gospels we know "],["787.36","that this happened and there is um this "],["790.16","part we don't necessarily know there's a "],["791.48","ceremony that Jesus may or may not have "],["793.16","done with uh the Passover which is "],["797.279","involves three pie pieces of matah which "],["800.24","it just means unleavened bread and so "],["802.56","they take a bag and it's has three "],["804.639","chambers in it and it's called the ehad "],["807.68","and the ehad translates to 2 one and so "],["811.04","what they do is they take these three "],["812.12","pieces of moah the first piece goes in "],["814.8","you don't see it again it doesn't come "],["816.12","out of the bag second piece they take "],["818.959","the matah crack it in half half of it "],["821.519","goes in the ehod the other half they "],["823.199","wrap in linen and set aside the third "],["826.92","matah they put in the bag but that's the "],["829.12","one they use and they pull it out later "],["830.56","for the actual "],["831.759","feast and I don't know if you guys are "],["833.72","paying "],["834.639","attention but do you notice that's the "],["837.72","trinity "],["839.8","because you have the three piece of mat "],["841.68","being put in a bag referred to as one "],["845.519","you have the one that goes in that is "],["846.8","never seen God the Father who no man has "],["849.199","ever seen you've got the son who was "],["851.88","broken for us the divine nature "],["853.959","returning to God the man part of him "],["856.639","being wrapped in linen then you got the "],["859.079","final the spirit the one that stays with "],["861.199","us even in the Jewish festivals they "],["864","have these images of the nature of God "],["868.72","which I is really "],["876.72","cool "],["878.48","so why does the matah have to be "],["881.48","unleavened well there's a couple of "],["883.279","reasons there's also more it has to be "],["885.16","unleavened has to be striped and it has "],["887.44","to be pierced those are the three think "],["889.92","like a Saltine cracker right the striped "],["893.16","and pierced portions refer directly to "],["894.88","the crucifixion of Christ because you "],["896.88","know you think to back to Isaiah 53 by "],["899.6","his stripes we are healed they put him "],["902","on the cross via nails so the unleavened "],["904.12","bread has to be striped and pierc "],["905.8","reflecting that part of Christ however "],["907.8","the unleavened why does it have to be "],["909.279","unleavened because the Practical side of "],["912.24","it it starts the Feast of unleavened "],["914.32","bread so they have to eat unleavened "],["916.32","bread for like a week after that so you "],["918.16","need all this unleavened bread to get "],["919.759","through the Feast of unle bread the "],["921.16","other side of it is you go back to the "],["922.399","first Passover what were they getting "],["923.839","ready for to leave so in order to leave "],["926.92","you can't sit around and let your bread "],["928.639","rise my wife has started making bread in "],["931.04","our house and it takes forever for that "],["933.519","I'm walking I'm like why is this on my "],["935.16","counter right now I need to use this "],["937.519","it's because it's rising so because it's "],["940.48","taking so long to rise if you're trying "],["942.72","to get ready to leave you can't wait for "],["944.959","it rise so you bake it and you go also "],["947.839","unleavened bread is a lot easier to pack "],["949.72","it's thinner more compact so you just "],["952","slide in your bag and get going um "],["955.12","that's the Practical side of it what's "],["956.759","the spiritual side of it throughout the "],["958.44","scripture unle or sorry leaven again "],["961.959","which we know is just yeast is usually "],["964.48","used as a symbol of "],["966.279","sin so you go to 1 Corinthians um 5 "],["971.72","6-8 and Paul "],["975.519","says your gloring is not good do you not "],["979.12","know that A little leaven leavens the "],["981.12","whole lump therefore Purge out the old "],["983.6","leaven that you may be a new lump since "],["985.92","you truly are unleavened for indeed "],["988.48","Christ our Passover was sacrificed for "],["990.6","us therefore let us keep the feast not "],["994.079","with old leaven or with the leaven of "],["995.56","malice and wickedness but with the unle "],["997.279","bread of sincerity and truth so we see "],["1000.319","the symbolism of Leaven being equated to "],["1003.6","sin so if we if we're going through the "],["1006.279","symbols here and we know that Christ was "],["1010.079","sinless the symbol that represents him "],["1012.6","has to be unleavened therefore sinless "],["1021.68","so after we get through all that next we "],["1024.319","take the third cup and uh jesus takes "],["1027.64","his third cup and he makes a statement "],["1029.28","this is the New Covenant in my blood "],["1030.72","which is shed for you now I couldn't "],["1033.039","find many sources on this one I only "],["1035.16","found one but each of the Cups have "],["1037.52","names um I don't remember exactly what "],["1039.64","the other two were but the third one is "],["1042.16","the cup of Jud or sorry H the cup of "],["1045.36","redemption which if you're following "],["1047.559","along make sense that this is the cup "],["1050.08","that Jesus Takes and then says this is "],["1053.12","my blood because by his blood we are "],["1056.039","redeemed so therefore the cup of the "],["1058.559","Redemption again we're paral or making "],["1061","parallels between these symbolisms or "],["1064.08","symbols if this is true completely makes "],["1067.2","sense and then after as I said before "],["1069.52","after this a Psalm or hym is sung that's "],["1072.28","consistent with modern Passover as well "],["1075.2","what does all of this have to do with a "],["1078.24","different interpret ation of communion "],["1080.4","well at the beginning we ask the "],["1081.919","question is this literal or "],["1085.24","metaphorical and the reality is that "],["1087.559","Passover itself is full of symbols that "],["1091.2","were never thought to be "],["1093.36","literal and in fact as I said the "],["1095.52","youngest is allowed to ask questions "],["1097.4","what do these mean it's known to be "],["1099.96","symbolic and throughout the gospels we "],["1102.799","see Jesus Take symbols and reveal the "],["1105.559","true meanings behind them uh Jesus talk "],["1108.76","talks about uh water and bread and "],["1111.44","equates himself to it why because "],["1113.32","without that water or bread we die well "],["1116.12","without food but we die right just like "],["1118.72","our need for Christ if we are without "],["1120.679","Christ we die and "],["1123.159","so he equates himself to a Shepherd or a "],["1126.76","gate and we know for a fact Jesus is not "],["1129.96","a gate right the point is there the "],["1133.039","symbol is there even the cross is a "],["1136.28","Redemption "],["1137.6","story The the cross was once a symbol of "],["1140.559","Shame suffering and "],["1142.919","humiliation is that what you want to "],["1144.6","decorate your house with nice Cross of "],["1147.44","Shame hanging on the wall over your "],["1149.28","microwave I don't know where

"],["1169.039","right now with Passover he's taking "],["1170.799","these and showing us the true meanings "],["1172.28","behind them he's taking a symbol that "],["1173.96","the Jews had and is

there is nothing within the "],["1188.039","elements "],["1189.559","themselves that become anything or "],["1192.32","impart anything to us the other "],["1194.919","interpretations of "],["1196.36","communion they put a large amount of "],["1198.36","emphasis on it providing Grace or even "],["1201.88","being needed for salvation in a "],["1205.32","way and that's just misses the

"],["1218.72","all Jesus Paid It "],["1220.679","All and that's so the reason for "],["1223.24","communion then why do we do it "],["1225.76","remembrance Jesus himself says that he "],["1228","says do this "],["1229.32","in remembrance of me and "],["1233.6","so I've been told that well that "],["1237.24","interpretation then takes all "],["1240.12","the I'm blanking on the word that "],["1242.52","interpretation then removes the respect "],["1245.76","that we are supposed to owe it away from "],["1248.08","it because well if it if it's just "],["1249.44","symbols what does it matter right that's "],["1251.76","not the case you see that we as humans "],["1255.52","we forget so easily it's just we just do "],["1259.72","and we just need that constant reminder "],["1262.039","I mean think about it yourself right how "],["1264.08","many of youall realize that this was "],["1265.48","here and it's not the first Sunday of "],["1267.12","the "],["1269.6","month so okay all "],["1272","right you two don't "],["1275","count right it it just kind of becomes "],["1277.799","part of the scenery it just becomes "],["1279.32","something we do but we need that "],["1281.4","constant reminder because we forget "],["1283.76","about it this table looks both backwards "],["1286.88","and forwards it looks backwards to the "],["1289.32","work of "],["1291.36","Christ and it is possible to hear the "],["1294.64","gospel so many times that we forget to "],["1296.64","let it affect us "],["1298.279","anymore I went to Bible college for six

"],["1428.96","us it convicts "],["1430.919","us another important thing to note is "],["1434.12","that because of the symbolic nature of "],["1436.679","this ordinance it means it can be done "],["1438.96","anywhere with anything by "],["1442","anyone if you're on a missions trip and "],["1445","wherever you are all you've got is fruit "],["1447.12","and "],["1448.679","Juice you can

"],["1459.4","right there is a warning attached to "],["1461.799","this though God takes his commands very "],["1466.679","seriously while the meaning may be "],["1468.96","symbolic the act of

"],["1479.52","unrepented sin they were overindulging "],["1482.399","which prevented other people from "],["1484.159","partaking and they were causing "],["1485.96","divisions within the church so because "],["1488.08","of this Paul provides the instructions "],["1490.24","but then he puts this warning on in "],["1491.72","verse 27 he says therefore whoever eats "],["1495.72","this bread or

Philippines (Guest Speaker Billy Morgan)","date":"2024-06-16","transcript":[["21.359","good morning everybody glad to be here "],["23.519","and nice to see everybody this is my "],["27.439","sixth time I think to came to come here "],["30.16","my for my family it's their first time "],["32.2","to visit and uh so it's my first time to "],["35.44","drive through here so it's it's a lot of "],["38.16","fun especially going through DC we went "],["40.079","through DC yesterday so uh but it it was "],["43.44","a nice trip and we've been traveling "],["45.239","since we left Los Angeles on May 13th so "],["48.399","we've been on a road driving for about "],["51.16","five weeks already we still got two two "],["53","and a half weeks more to go before we go "],["54.719","to Alabama for a year so uh we'll be "],["57.92","near Mobile Alabama so we're so thankful "],["60.8","to be here this morning and if you have "],["62.84","your Bibles open to Romans chapter 1 "],["65.92","verse "],["70.36","8 I'd like to share with you uh our goal "],["73.92","as Christians what is our goal in life "],["77.799","and every believer our goal should be to "],["80.36","grow into "],["81.88","maturity and uh this is Paul's prayer "],["85","and desire for the Romans as well so the "],["87.4","book of Romans was written by the "],["88.759","Apostle Paul and he's writing from "],["91.52","Corinth Corinth is in modern day Greece "],["94.64","so if you look near well just above "],["96.24","Greece so if you look at the map uh that "],["99.92","would it take a long time to get there "],["102.84","especially back then and he has a prayer "],["105.96","he shares his desire to establish "],["108.04","Believers I'm going to focus on verse 11 "],["110.64","and uh he is writing from Corinth and "],["113.28","establishing the Corinthians and their "],["115.439","faith but he wants to go he shares his "],["117.28","desire to go to Rome so verse eight "],["120.28","first I thank my God through Jesus "],["122.32","Christ for you all because your faith is "],["125.84","being proclaimed throughout the whole "],["127.64","world so I believe this means here that "],["130.959","Paul was commending them for not "],["134.879","just talking the talk but they were "],["137.84","really walking the walk and other "],["140.12","churches other believers other groups "],["142","people around the Roman Empire we're "],["144.2","hearing about the faith of the Roman "],["146.959","Believers so let's hope and our prayer "],["150.8","and desire for this church here at Faith "],["152.76","Bible Church and for our lives as well "],["155.879","is that we will be a witness for an "],["158.92","encouragement to fellow Believers and be "],["161.04","a witness to unbelievers as well not "],["163.04","just with our words but also with our "],["164.519","life and our actions as well for both "],["166.239","are important for God whom I serve in my "],["169.8","spirit and the preaching of the Gospel "],["171.959","of his son is my witness as to how "],["176","unceasingly I make mention of you so we "],["179.92","see here that Paul's "],["182.519","request and he you can see the life of "],["187","his prayer Life In this passage here if "],["190.08","you want to know what is the most "],["192.36","important thing that Paul prays "],["194.319","for and it those you can look at two "],["197.08","passages of scripture if You' like to "],["198.36","write this down Ephesians 1: "],["202.64","15-9 and Ephesians chap 3:1 15- "],["206.84","21 I believe that Paul has prayer "],["210.48","requests for physical needs Financial "],["213.08","emotional all that's part and we should "],["215.08","pray for those as well James 5 says that "],["217.239","we should pray for one another that we "],["219.08","be may be healed so that that is true "],["222.599","Paul we see Paul's prayer is that "],["224.879","epaphroditus be healed in Philippians "],["227","chapter "],["227.84","2 but the main critical thing that we "],["230.92","all need as Believers is that we grow "],["233.48","into spiritual maturity and that's pray "],["236.36","for our spiritual growth our spiritual "],["238.36","healing and that will grow into Grace "],["242.319","Peter says the same thing in 2 Peter "],["244.12","3:18 but grow in the grace and knowledge "],["246.519","of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so "],["248.92","that is Paul's request that's his prayer "],["250.92","that's his desire is that people will "],["253.079","come to fa uh to maturity so not just a "],["256","saving Faith but continue to live out "],["258.16","their faith and their lives as "],["260.919","well verse 10 always in my prayers "],["264","making request if perhaps now At Last by "],["268.479","the will of God I I may succeed in "],["272.08","coming to you so if we know from church "],["275.639","history "],["277.759","Paul uh was not the founder of this "],["280.24","church in "],["281.24","Rome we don't really know who started it "],["284.24","many theologians think that the people "],["286.28","that left Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 uh "],["289.24","Believers went back and started this "],["291.32","church could have been the followers of "],["293.12","Paul his disciples but it wasn't Paul "],["295.639","himself who started it so that means "],["297.6","that these people that he's writing to "],["299.479","he prays for them maybe he doesn't know "],["302.12","everybody by "],["303.36","name but yet he desires to come to them "],["307.759","and visit them for fellowship and for "],["309.479","growth so uh never been there yet he "],["312.96","wants to make Rome a base for further "],["315.52","Missionary Training and teaching and he "],["317.4","wants to meet these Believers face to "],["319.36","face verse 11 for I long to see you I "],["323.319","desire to see you in order that I may "],["325.759","impart some spiritual gift to you that "],["329.319","you may be "],["331.56","established so here in verse 11 I "],["334.6","believe the spiritual gift is referring "],["336.479","to his equipping his establishing them "],["339.199","in the faith this is the key verse that "],["341.96","I want to leave behind to you this "],["343.56","morning is the word establish it means "],["347.08","to "],["347.919","strengthen so again as I mentioned the "],["351.72","the most important thing in our life is "],["354.12","our growth and walk with the Lord and it "],["357.08","it it surpasses everything and that's "],["360.199","what Paul wants to do he wants to equip "],["362.68","and he wants to establish these "],["364.96","Believers in the faith that's what he "],["366.96","wants to go to Rome that's why he wants "],["368.759","to be with these "],["369.84","Believers verse 12 that is that I may be "],["373.08","encouraged together with you while among "],["375.24","you each of us by the other's Faith both "],["378.88","yours and mine Christianity I I remember "],["382.039","this a long time ago this expression "],["384.16","where Christianity is not an island it's "],["386.4","not a Onan sport as well right we're in "],["389.199","this thing "],["390.16","together so even as the Apostle to the "],["393.28","Gentiles one of the most famous people "],["395.919","in all of Christianity he needs to be "],["398.12","encouraged as well so we have spiritual "],["400.56","gifts God has given us spiritual gifts "],["402.68","to encourage each other Paul's gift was "],["405.759","to go in there to Rome to further equip "],["408.52","and to teach these Roman Believers and "],["412.52","each believer was to respond by "],["415","ministering to and sharing and "],["418.84","encouraging the life of the Apostle Paul "],["420.68","as well so it's a mutual thing and "],["423.599","that's what he desired and he wanted to "],["426.08","be he wanted to equi them but he also "],["428.8","wanted to be encouraged as well and to "],["431.28","encouraged by their stories and their "],["432.84","testimonies and everything that's going "],["434.96","on in their "],["436.479","lives verse 13 and I do not want you to "],["439.84","be unaware Brethren that I've often "],["441.639","planned to come to you and have been "],["443.639","prevented thus far in order that I might "],["446.28","obtain some fruit among you even as "],["449.759","among the rest of the Gentiles so we see "],["453.599","that Paul has a plan but yet he leaves "],["456.479","it to the will of God we we all make our "],["460.08","plans and we should be planful in our "],["461.599","life just like Paul is but we have to be "],["464.039","flexible knowing that God sometimes "],["466.36","overrides our plans and that's what Paul "],["468.84","is here if you know anything about the "],["471.199","Bible and the the the churches that Paul "],["473.639","was ministering to he's in "],["476.8","Corinth and we know that the Corinthian "],["479.199","believer need help they're into "],["481.28","immorality they're into all sorts of "],["483","problems divisions Strife in their "],["485.639","Church even false teachings about the "],["488.12","future Resurrection they need help and "],["491.199","God was not yet done with the Apostle "],["493.199","Paul in Corinth and God was not yet "],["495.879","ready to send him to "],["498.319","Rome but I believe Paul gets this "],["501.4","request answered if you read acts chap "],["504.12","28 and we know that Paul was arrested in "],["507","Jerusalem acts chap 21:22 "],["509.96","he makes an appeal to Caesar we can read "],["512.159","that from acts 21-28 and he gets to go "],["515","to Rome but not as a free man and he "],["518.64","gets put in House of rest for two years "],["521.24","and if we see that in Acts chapter 28 "],["523.44","and God answers his request here I "],["525.48","believe because during House of rest he "],["527.76","can go he cannot go out and visit people "],["530","but people can come to him and I believe "],["532.8","that Paul God answers his request and "],["536.64","people can come to him and then talk to "],["538.36","him he can teach them and and share with "],["540.279","them and we can see what happens there "],["544.2","and the rest of the story is found in "],["546.279","Philippians chapter 1 in Acts chapter 28 "],["549.399","where God answers his request so but the "],["553.6","issue is this he wants to obtain some "],["555.76","fruit meaning the result what is the "],["558","result why does Paul want to go to Rome "],["560.32","why does he want to establish them is "],["562.12","that they grow into "],["563.76","maturity and that should be our goal in "],["567.079","life as well verse 11 establishing so "],["569.959","the question is the challenge I want to "],["571.32","leave to you today is are you being "],["575.519","established in the "],["576.839","faith are do are you making time in the "],["579.44","word of God and listening to the word of "],["582.079","God and not just hearing but also "],["584.519","applying the word of God to your life "],["586.72","secondly are you making him known to "],["589.2","others and uh we know today is Father's "],["593.12","day so if you're a father and you have a "],["598.04","a very big role in the life of your "],["600.399","family so I encourage all the fathers "],["602.399","here to be the Shepherd in your family "],["605.76","to be the godly man that you can be and "],["608.24","really equip and to your children and "],["611.04","the faith and Ephesians chapter 6 says "],["613.36","to what nurture to lead them in the "],["615.72","nurture and abnom mission of the Lord so "],["618.36","important so you might not be a father "],["620.32","you could uh not all of us are pastors "],["622.399","or missionaries or teachers but we can "],["625.88","always be involved in equipping uh maybe "],["629.519","mentoring uh encouraging somebody with "],["631.88","their walk with the Lord that that can "],["634.32","be our role as well and then we might "],["636.88","not be able to go to the mission field "],["638.639","you know not everybody's led to go or "],["640.959","called to go to a foreign country but "],["643.639","yet we could be in this supporting role "],["646.16","you know maybe we could be behind the "],["647.8","scenes helps Ministry you know preparing "],["650.92","things for the team that's going or we "],["653.079","could be the prayer warriors praying for "],["655.16","the team before they go out so God gives "],["657.8","us special roles in the church "],["659.76","and we are all in this together and I "],["662.079","believe that as Christians our goal is "],["664","to establish each other and help each "],["665.56","other in the faith so I'd like to share "],["667.6","this video and I'm going to uh discuss "],["670.399","our mission report "],["674.399","now and discuss that and if we have time "],["677.16","I'd like to open up the question and "],["678.68","anwers if you have any questions uh near "],["681.32","the end if there's time remaining I can "],["683.839","uh we can do a quick question and answer "],["686.76","time so I'm going to skip the part about "],["689.04","the introduction to our family you guys "],["691.279","can talk to them right there they're "],["692.6","right there on the third row so you know "],["695.32","just some "],["697.32","pictures of our "],["700.36","family and the Philippines is in "],["702.639","Southeast Asia is about 10,000 miles "],["705.519","away and some of our bordering nations "],["708.32","are China to the Northwest Indonesia and "],["711.44","Japan is really far north as well we're "],["713.839","in Luzon that's in the northern "],["716.079","Philippines and there's some of the "],["717.68","places that we've been to uh over the "],["720.279","past couple of years that we've done "],["732.68","Ministry just a little history so uh the "],["736.24","Philippines was settled by Spain in "],["739.68","1521 and there was a guy from history "],["742.56","you might know feran melan and the the "],["745.44","Philippines was ruled by the Spanish for "],["747.16","over 300 years it became a US territory "],["750.279","in "],["751.36","1899 uh so it was uh it's kind of like "],["754.92","what we consider Puerto Rico today and "],["757.399","it was a big Battleground during World "],["758.959","War II before I a lot of elderly people "],["762.519","they would tell me oh I was in the "],["763.88","Philippines and this time and so it was "],["766.32","a a big time Battleground even during "],["769.199","Vietnam before the soldiers would go to "],["771.48","Vietnam they would stop in the "],["772.92","Philippines uh as a base and some of the "],["775.279","two bases there before they went to "],["777.199","Vietnam and it became an indep country "],["779.72","in "],["787.32","1946 also in the Philippines there's two "],["789.88","national languages Filipino or what they "],["792.32","call Tagalog and English and nearly all "],["795.959","Filipinos can communicate in basic "],["798.56","English so uh the tagalo language is as "],["802.519","similar to some there's some Spanish "],["804.36","Origins but it's very similar to "],["806.16","Indonesian or Malaysian and like I said "],["809.12","said because it was a US Territory for "],["810.76","almost 50 years most Filipinos can speak "],["813.24","in English and there's over 120 "],["815.399","different dialects and local languages "],["818.04","in the Philippines and if you ever been "],["820.04","around uh if you have any I know there's "],["821.88","Filipino people live in the area "],["823.32","probably most of you had Lumia before "],["825.6","that's a very famous food pretty yummy "],["827.399","not very healthy but it's really "],["837.399","yummy so this is our main "],["840.519","Ministry our main Ministry is to train "],["843.72","pastors and many churches many people in "],["847.079","the Philippines uh they have been "],["848.959","affected and they believe that salvation "],["851.36","is by works by doing good deeds we know "],["853.36","the Bible teaches the opposite it's by "],["855.88","Christ it's by Grace It Is by faith not "],["858.92","by works so what we want to do is "],["862.12","because of all the false teaching in the "],["864.399","Philippines and around the world we know "],["866.32","false teaching has always been around us "],["868.16","even in the first century "],["869.639","it's been around us so me and Teresa "],["872.72","went back in 2010 she's from the "],["874.44","Philippines and we wanted to equip the "],["877.24","pastors because if you train the pastor "],["880.079","you train the congregation indirectly so "],["882.839","that was our goal and there's a lot of "],["885.32","uh uh there's a lot of churches and a "],["887.68","lot of pastors but a lot of pastors they "],["889.72","can't really uh explain the Bible very "],["892.32","well they don't have enough training in "],["894","Bible interpretation so our really our "],["896.32","main focus is Bible interpretation and "],["899.519","we we have a theological term for that "],["901","called hermeneutics so it's a Bible "],["903.199","interpretation really training we train "],["905.759","them in how to interpret the Bible "],["907.759","there's an expression you don't just "],["909.399","teach a give a man a fish you teach him "],["911.92","how to fish that's the same way we're "],["913.72","training pastors so of course we teach "],["916.639","theology but we also train when you when "],["920.079","you come to that verse how do you how do "],["921.92","you interpret that verse what are the "],["923.519","tools you know there's tools involved in "],["926.759","in learning the Bible so that's what we "],["929","do for our pastoral and Leadership "],["930.56","training we have four different training "],["932.279","centers around uh in our about four or "],["935.639","five hour radius so our first class is "],["938.36","in bagio city and uh we have another "],["942.279","class in bang onion that's

never been "],["1506.96","to Africa before and it was a fun time "],["1510.96","and so I'm really thankful to "],["1513.559","that for that trip so in this picture "],["1517.159","here there's about 40 pastors so we had "],["1519.279","to go into to Northern Zambia uh and we "],["1523.6","were there for two four days two "],["1527.159","different two-day Pastor seminars in "],["1530.24","Zambia now Zambia is like it's really "],["1534.52","sad because out of this picture here I "],["1538.08","uh there's 40 pastors there from "],["1540.919","different villages in "],["1542.64","Zambia and 35 out of 40 did not own a "],["1546.72","Bible it's really sad you're a pastor of "],["1549.2","a church and you don't own a Bible so "],["1550.919","the biggest struggle in Africa uh was "],["1554.88","economic meaning that they can't afford "],["1557.36","what would be about 10 or $15 Bible and "],["1560.12","I don't know CU I know in the "],["1561.2","Philippines we have a lot of "],["1562.2","organizations that give out free Bibles "],["1564.12","I don't know anybody that doesn't own "],["1565.32","the Bible it's easy to find a Bible you "],["1567.08","can even get a Bible on your cell phone "],["1568.84","how many bibles do we own a lot so I so "],["1571.679","I was just amazed at like wow but "],["1574.799","thankfully our organization was able to "],["1576.48","provide the funds so that every Pastor "],["1578.96","would have the money to own a Bible and "],["1581.2","then we wanted to make sure that if "],["1582.799","you're a pastor and even if you're a "],["1584.799","Christian we should have a Bible right "],["1587.2","maybe they had a new test some of them I "],["1589.799","I didn't know what they were using but "],["1592.36","many of them did not own a Bible and so "],["1594.36","we also were able to teach out of a book "],["1596.399","called "],["1597.159","foundations and it really is a it's a "],["1599.52","theology book they call it a seminary in "],["1601.72","a book and so we just did two days of "],["1604.52","just focusing on Bible interpretation "],["1608.08","again we wanted to make sure that the "],["1609.64","pastors they had a theology book because "],["1612.6","nobody had a theology book if if if very "],["1615.44","only five of them own a Bible and they "],["1617.279","wanted to make sure they had a Bible I "],["1619.08","would have loved to stay and just share "],["1622.039","and it just it really like thrilled my "],["1624.2","soul because they said it's like Mana "],["1626.52","from Heaven you know our teaching there "],["1628.72","because there's no seminary in this "],["1630.08","place and they're really far from "],["1632.12","training most of these Village pastors "],["1634.919","have very little theological training so "],["1638.08","uh if the Lord would if they would allow "],["1640.039","me to go back I would love to SP stay "],["1641.64","and spend time there training Pastors in "],["1644.039","this place in Northern Zambia so Zambia "],["1646.64","there's a lot of Christianity "],["1648.76","and but yet there's not a lot of like "],["1651.679","it's kind of mixed with a lot of pagan "],["1653.399","religions and things like that so it's a "],["1655.159","real struggle for the pastors we're very "],["1657.88","thankful for our team there in Zambia "],["1660.24","and our these are our cooks and our host "],["1662.799","who were able to provide our meals for "],["1664.44","the 40 Pastors in "],["1666.919","attendance so here the guy to the left "],["1669.48","of being

that so we've and we're "],["1851.76","going to continue this Bible study even "],["1853.279","now so very thankful to our our online "],["1856.12","Bible study Ministry "],["1859.559","we've been taught eschatology on "],["1861.76","Saturday evenings to a "],["1865.159","group and uh ever since "],["1868.039","2019 our the church in Alabama that "],["1870.44","we've been a part of we've had we have a "],["1872.96","host Church down in near Mobile Alabama "],["1876.2","and Teresa joined this ESL Ministry the "],["1879.08","church has taken up upon themselves "],["1881.279","there is a lot of people coming to the "],["1882.799","United States and many of them don't "],["1885.399","speak English very well so they really "],["1887.44","need to be trained in the English "],["1888.96","language so this church teaches English "],["1891.96","classes for free anybody wants to join "],["1895.639","how to communicate in basic English "],["1897.559","English is a really hard language to "],["1899","learn actually it is we think we really "],["1901.32","take it for granted but and so Teresa "],["1903.96","was able to join this ministry and "],["1906.76","ladies uh and men in different countries "],["1909.799","they come from Japan Korea Brazil Mexico "],["1913.679","all around the world they're coming to "],["1915.039","the United States and maybe their "],["1917.159","husbands are working "],["1918.559","or they get a job temporarily or "],["1920.48","whatever and so the the church's goal "],["1923.72","was not just it to be a uh an English "],["1928.2","Ministry but it's also the share the "],["1930.2","word of God and the gospel and that's "],["1932.76","what Teresa did that the there was a "],["1934.559","lady who was a missionary to Indonesia "],["1937.48","for 40 years her and her husband started "],["1939.72","this ministry in the church but she "],["1941.559","could not she got to the point where she "],["1942.919","was developing dementia she couldn't "],["1944.799","handle the L's Bible study anymore so "],["1946.279","she turned it over to Teresa so she's "],["1948.399","been doing this online well it was "],["1950.559","originally face to face and we went back "],["1952.88","to the Philippines Teresa was able to "],["1955.24","continue this ministry via Zoom to these "],["1958.519","ladies and some of these ladies moved "],["1960.36","back to different country the lady that "],["1962.039","from Japan she went back to Japan "],["1964.76","another lady from Alabama she was living "],["1967.96","uh from Brazil but living in Alabama she "],["1970.2","went up back she moved to Pittsburgh so "],["1974.32","we were able to do this ministry via "],["1976.88","online and she conducts online Bible "],["1978.88","studies to these "],["1981.36","ladies uh via "],["1984.6","zoom and and also I wanted to highlight "],["1987.519","in our presentation of what we do "],["1989.399","different Camp Ministries and through "],["1992","our church so the next few Ministries "],["1993.559","are mainly through our church ministry "],["1995.679","that we've been a part of we've done "],["1997.44","family camps every year so our family "],["2000","Camp is normally "],["2001.919","during uh Holy Week Holy Week is the "],["2005.039","week before Easter in the Philippines "],["2007.159","everything sh down there's no like "],["2009.48","people take off work there very few "],["2011.96","companies shut down and that's the time "],["2014.399","that we do it so these family camps are "],["2016.519","a little bit Evangelistic we normally go "],["2018.72","to the beach or go to a place but it's "],["2021.279","also big on discipleship as well so it's "],["2023.88","a time of bonding and family time and uh "],["2027.96","gospel sharing and "],["2035.279","discipleship during the co Pand mic we "],["2038.799","had the strictest "],["2041.679","uh just for a second we had the "],["2044.36","strictest regulations out of any country "],["2047.2","the Philippines it was one of the "],["2048.639","strictest models when it comes to "],["2050.159","lockdowns and things like that literally "],["2053.399","we could not travel to the next Province "],["2056.8","every the government it it restricted "],["2059.48","our movement so it'd be like you cannot "],["2061.76","go to Virginia if you're in Maryland "],["2064.639","something like that so we were stuck in "],["2066.72","our city for a year or we could only do "],["2068.839","online Ministries and there was also "],["2070.919","age-based restrictions as well during "],["2073.04","the covid pandemic so if you were over "],["2075.32","the age of 60 you cannot leave your "],["2077.159","residence for two years unless for "],["2079.96","medical reasons only so it was very "],["2083.679","strict also if you're under the age of "],["2086","20 you can not leave your residence as "],["2088.24","well unless for medical reasons so we "],["2090.56","did not start face Toof face for the "],["2092.119","kids schooling until August of 2022 "],["2094.679","which is relatively recent so is that "],["2096.8","way for 2 years years so if you can "],["2099.04","imagine the mental health of the people "],["2101.4","it it was very challenging and with "],["2103.88","young people so back in 20122 we "],["2107.2","restarted our youth ministry uh through "],["2109.8","our local church because obviously uh "],["2113.28","the kids have been through you know this "],["2115.359","very challenging so we were really "],["2117.52","wanting to focus on youth again uh "],["2119.92","during that time so that was our we "],["2122.92","started our summer camp again and Teresa "],["2125.72","was able to do as she's she handles the "],["2128.8","youth ministry of our church so even "],["2130.599","while we're here in the US she's "],["2132.28","delegated

love what "],["219.799","habach does in his book because "],["221.72","basically habach is having a "],["224.56","conversation with god and he's basically "],["227.799","complaining to God about the state of "],["229.519","the world Hab habc is saying God don't "],["231.799","you see what's happening in our world "],["233.76","God look at all this craziness that's "],["235.879","happening have you you know have you "],["238.04","lost your mind are you even involved "],["240.28","God do you even care about what's "],["242.28","happening in our world and this is God's "],["244.72","response

"],["285.12","unprecedented ways and I love this "],["287.36","scripture verse in in habach 1:6 it says "],["290.639","the next thing that God says to his is "],["293.24","uh I'm raising up the "],["296.08","Babylonians and imagine that you know CU "],["298.44","in the Bible whenever we read about "],["299.88","Babylon or the Babylonians they're "],["301.4","always the enemies they're always the "],["303.08","bad guys but God is saying even in this "],["306.16","crazy time I can use whoever I want to "],["309.44","for whatever I want to use them for so "],["311.479","no matter how crazy it gets God can even "],["314.32","use Babylonians so don't get discouraged "],["317.36","by what you're seeing happening in the "],["319.479","world because God can use anyone that he "],["323.4","chooses so this is what our objectives "],["325.96","are today is to have you feel the weight "],["328.8","of your giving and your prayers and also "],["331.16","to offer you encouragement in terms of "],["333.639","what's happening in the world today so "],["337.16","um I'm share these scripture verses with "],["338.96","you the the the next one if we can go to "],["341.88","the next one one of the things that we "],["343.919","are involved in in the Philippines is uh "],["347.199","foster care and adoptive care now we "],["349.84","started that here and we were actually "],["352","involved in foster care and adoption "],["354.199","here within Maryland that's how we got "],["356.319","our lovely daughter Tiani and our son "],["358.28","Byron was through foster care and "],["360.72","adoption so we've always been an "],["362.08","advocate because this is what it says in "],["363.6","Psalms 68:5 and 6 it says that and this "],["366.72","is talking about God a father to the "],["368.52","fatherless a defender of widows is God "],["370.96","in his holy dwelling and God sets the "],["373.68","lowly and families and in James 127 it "],["376.52","says religion that God our Father "],["378.24","accepts as pure and faultless is this to "],["380.56","look after orphans and widows in their "],["382.56","distress and to keep oneself from being "],["384.8","polluted by the world so if God is a "],["387.24","father to the fatherless then we should "],["389.24","follow that example so we've always been "],["391.479","involved in foster care and adoption so "],["395.319","when we moved our family to the "],["397.28","Philippines we realize that there is an "],["399.52","orphan crisis in the Philippines the "],["401.88","Philippines has a population of about "],["404.56","117 million people and there are "],["407.24","estimates that they have almost 8 "],["409.199","million orphans crazy think about that "],["413.319","so there is an orphan crisis in the "],["415.84","Philippines when we arrived there we "],["417.919","made friends with a pastor his name is "],["420.24","Pastor Mark and he has a vision and a "],["422.56","heart to end the orphan crisis in the "],["425.639","Philippines and so God gave him a divine "],["428.72","plan and in his prayer this is what God "],["431.28","showed him he looked at a map of our "],["434.039","region and he mapped out all the "],["435.96","churches he counted all of the churches "],["438.24","in our region we had about over a "],["440","thousand Evangelical churches within our "],["442.84","region and then he looked at our same "],["444.919","region to see how many orphans that we "],["447.199","have in institutions and in uh in foster "],["450.759","care and in in these places we had "],["453.599","634 so it's simple math he looked at it "],["456.639","and he said if every Church would take "],["459.599","one orphan we could end the orphan "],["462.12","crisis in our region and so we got "],["465.759","behind that and and we we partnered with "],["468.44","Pastor Mark to start serving uh foster "],["470.919","parents and foster children and adoptive "],["473.039","parents and adopted children and because "],["475.24","of that we "],["476.759","ourselves um as our family we got "],["478.8","approved for for foster care with DWD "],["481.879","DWD is the same would be equivalent to "],["484.599","like DSS here Department of Social "],["486.44","Services here so anytime you hear me say "],["488.319","DWD that's what I'm talking about um so "],["491.639","we started working with "],["493.36","DWD one day we got a call from dswd and "],["498.24","they said we have found a baby in a "],["502.879","field on a neighboring Island would you "],["506.28","take him and we said yes I want to show "],["509.24","you "],["510.36","this video I'm warning you it's um it's "],["514.12","it's graphic at Point some of the things "],["515.719","are blurred but it's kind of graphic but "],["517.519","I want to show you this video as I tell "],["519.039","you his story there's no sound because "],["520.8","it's in heligan which is the local "],["522.88","dialect so you wouldn't understand it "],["524.32","anyway but this is what dswd told us "],["527.92","they told us there was a baby that was "],["529.64","found in a sugar cane "],["532.72","field one morning around 5:00 a.m. in "],["535.68","the rain a sugar cane worker was walking "],["538.72","through the sugar fields and when I'm "],["540.399","talking about a sugarcan field I am not "],["543.12","talking about a little garden siiz thing "],["545.32","I'm talking about sugar cane for as far "],["548.64","as the eye can see from the ocean to the "],["551.399","mountain sugar cane in every "],["554.959","direction and this guy was walking at "],["557.68","5:00 a.m. in the rain through the "],["560.36","sugarcane field and he heard a baby "],["563.16","crying and he looked over and he saw "],["565.8","that yellow bag right there and he "],["568.36","opened up the yellow bag and in it he "],["570.92","found a newborn "],["572.68","baby with the umbilical cord and the "],["575.36","placenta still attached so DWD calls us "],["580.32","and they said will you take this "],["582.16","baby and we said yes but we got to we're "],["584.56","gonna talk to our kids first so we got "],["587.76","off the phone with DWD and we called our "],["589.68","friends our our kids down to talk with "],["592.6","them and uh you know get their "],["595.36","input and um and and pray so we call "],["599.04","them and my oldest daughter or my second "],["601.48","oldest daughter Beyond Tiani was there "],["605.16","Tiani was almost she was getting ready "],["607.12","to leave at that point so we call them "],["609.76","all down my second oldest daughter sa "],["612.959","she says she's 16 at that point and she "],["616.76","says um she said we're we're sitting "],["619.519","there we're saying hey they found a baby "],["621.76","and she just says yes yes yes and we're "],["626.04","like and they've asked us to take a yes "],["628","yes and she she told us she said I I've "],["631.16","been praying that God would give us a "],["632.72","baby so he said sa that's great but you "],["636.8","you should be uh you should be asking us "],["640.12","before you pray for stuff like that "],["642.12","right so so all the kids agreed they "],["645.32","said yes what you know we want we want "],["647.6","this baby so we prayed and we prayed "],["650.44","right then and there we were praying God "],["652.16","we pray over this baby we pray that the "],["654.68","baby would be healthy we pray that the "],["656.959","baby uh you know there would be no ill "],["659.32","effects from what has happened and we "],["660.88","just began to to to just pray and speak "],["663.56","the name of Jesus over that baby and one "],["665.24","of the things that we prayed for "],["666.519","specifically was his name because in the "],["669.44","Philippines it what happens a lot is "],["672.36","when they find babies like this they "],["674.16","usually name it something crazy or they "],["676.519","name it according to the place that it "],["678.72","was found and to us that really that "],["680.88","really spoke to me because I think I "],["682.519","think that that's how the enemy operates "],["684.44","a lot of times he wants to call us by "],["686.639","where we're found he wants to call us by "],["688.88","our sin he wants to call us by our "],["690.44","circumstances but God has a Divine "],["692.839","Destiny and he doesn't call us by where "],["694.88","we're found he's calling us to who he is "],["697.72","and the Divine destiny that he has for "],["699.48","each of us and so that's what we prayed "],["701.6","for that baby we said God please don't "],["703.44","let them name that baby something crazy "],["705.92","and we pray that you would put a name on "],["708.16","that child that would that would "],["712.519","speak to his "],["715.839","Destiny "],["718.079","so we we prayed we we got off the phone "],["721.92","with DWD and um we were just um we're "],["727","waiting to hear back because here's how "],["728.24","it works in the "],["729.68","Philippines they they don't just "],["732.12","automatically put a child in your home "],["733.56","you have to go to a matching committee "],["735.6","like I I once heard it said that God so "],["738.079","loved the world that he did not send a "],["739.76","committee thank God you know you know "],["742.199","committees can be kind of difficult at "],["743.8","times but that's the way it works in the "],["745.32","Philippines you have a committee that "],["747.04","choose that takes a child and chooses a "],["749.36","for him so you have the family you have "],["750.68","the child and the committee is the one "],["752.6","that lines them them up so you have to "],["755.12","be chosen uh for that so when DWD asked "],["758.48","us for that and uh we said yes that we "],["761.44","would be considered to be placed for him "],["763.519","but we went by two two months nothing we "],["765.8","didn't hear anything and so we figured "],["768.48","that they had placed him in another "],["770.76","family two months later they call us "],["774.399","keep in mind this is in the middle of "],["775.88","covid this is 2021 they call us uh to "],["779.16","two months later and they say that baby "],["781.639","has been selected for you we're going to "],["784.079","place him in your home we're like wait a "],["785.839","minute where's this baby been it's been "],["788.16","two months and so they said well what "],["791.44","had happened was there was a covid "],["793.519","tracing that uh you know not even an "],["796.16","outbreak but just a tracing that someone "],["798.16","had gone into that office that had covid "],["800.56","and so they had to lock down the whole "],["802","office so this baby was stuck in this "],["804.36","office with Caregivers for two months "],["807.12","and so Emily's like we're going to get "],["809.16","get him tomorrow so uh so she uh she did "],["814.12","she went over and um and she got him and "],["817.48","he was he's been in in our home so uh "],["821.32","about a year and a half "],["824.24","later they see here in the US right when "],["827.399","you do foster care it can naturally lead "],["829.32","to adoption in the Philippines you have "],["831.8","to do that process of selection again so "],["834.16","just because you're chose for the the "],["836.04","foster home doesn't mean you're going to "],["837.72","be chosen for the "],["839.759","the to become the adoptive parents and "],["842.44","so um about a year and a half later they "],["846.88","contact us and they they say Emmanuel is "],["850.88","going to be and by the way they when "],["853.759","when they first called us they said they "],["855.36","said oh let me let me tell you his name "],["858.519","and they said his name is Emmanuel which "],["862.48","means God With Us amen so so God put his "],["866.24","name on there and then the selection "],["867.839","committee said the reason that they "],["869.6","chose him for us was because he uh he "],["874.079","had a Biblical name so they wanted to "],["875.68","put him with the missionaries so the "],["877.399","whole reason that he was that he was "],["879.279","chosen for us was because of his name so "],["882.44","so uh they so Emanuel was with us for "],["885.32","two months or for for I'm sorry uh a "],["888.279","year and a half and all of a sudden now "],["890.36","his he's going to be up for adoption and "],["893.24","they you know we had submitted all of "],["895.079","the paperwork that we needed to adopt "],["896.959","him but there was one piece of paper "],["898.839","that was missing because it doesn't "],["901.36","exist they wanted something from the US "],["904.519","uh government that the US government "],["906.399","does not do or does not have actually no "],["908.759","nation in the world has it except for "],["910.72","Spain but it's a requirement for "],["912.32","international adoptions and so we're "],["915.68","saying we're we just L we we lose our "],["918.8","minds because they're saying he is going "],["920.399","to be placed in another family next "],["923.8","Friday his matching committee and he is "],["926.279","going to be placed in another family "],["929.839","and so we "],["931.24","sayoh man we have we have to pray we're "],["933.56","like can't you just wait for us to get "],["935.079","this paperwork and they're like no he's "],["936.959","we have to match him with another family "],["938.48","so we are we're crying you know we get "],["940.92","that news and and

"],["1598.64","Netherlands during covid because they "],["1600.96","said the gospel cannot be stopped and so "],["1604.399","we decided that we weren't going to let "],["1606.44","the gospel be stopped either where we "],["1608.96","were and we started our Outreach to uh "],["1612.6","the panai binan tribe now we had thought "],["1616.64","of starting our one child program how "],["1619.44","many of you anybody ever heard of one "],["1621.279","child yeah I know I know you have CA and "],["1624.399","S yeah so uh how many of you heard of "],["1627.679","compassion Compassion International "],["1629.44","right yeah we also work with compassion "],["1632.399","one child is very similar to compassion "],["1634.279","it's a child sponsorship program "],["1635.96","compassion has like a million kids "],["1637.64","worldwide with one child we only have "],["1640.039","about 45,000 right now at this point but "],["1642.48","we're on our way to 100,000 but we've we "],["1645.32","partnered with one child during uh "],["1648.32","during the pandemic and we started doing "],["1650.799","work we want we wanted to start a Hope "],["1652.76","Center there amongst the panai buidan "],["1656","tribe the problem was we didn't have we "],["1659.52","didn't have like qualified Christians "],["1661.48","there was only a handful of Christians "],["1663.24","there and really none of them were "],["1664.64","qualified to lead children's ministry so "],["1668.32","we just threw our hands up and we said "],["1670.24","oh we give up we "],["1671.84","quit no no that's not what the gospel "],["1675.32","does see we have to take the limits off "],["1677.399","so we say okay if if there aren't "],["1679.6","qualified people if there's if there's "],["1682.2","not somebody to run this program that "],["1683.919","God is calling us to do let's raise them "],["1685.72","up so we said okay we are going to have "],["1688.48","a Bible school so we had our Bible "],["1691.159","school we started our Bible school with "],["1692.679","the panan on booki non tribe in the "],["1694.96","middle of the "],["1696.96","pandemic so we go there to have our "],["1699.96","Bible school and we walk in and this is "],["1701.679","the first thing that we "],["1705.279","see this is blood smear on the Walls by "],["1709.32","a witch "],["1711.08","doctor they took they sacrificed pigs "],["1715","and chickens and they smeared the the "],["1717.72","blood on the walls now a lot of people "],["1720.6","would be like oh we can't have a Bible "],["1723","school here because this place is "],["1725.159","Tainted and it's demonic and that's true "],["1727.76","those things are demonic but when we saw "],["1730.039","this we were actually excited and "],["1731.679","encouraged because we were thinking man "],["1734.039","if the enemy wants these people how much "],["1737.12","more does Jesus want these people you "],["1739.279","see cuz they're willing to give the "],["1741","blood of animals but God was willing to "],["1743.399","give the blood of his "],["1744.76","son and so we got excited because we "],["1747.36","know this is right where God wants us "],["1750.64","because we're pushing about back against "],["1752.6","strongholds and strong places and all of "],["1755","these things and so that blood we went "],["1757.799","in and we saw that blood on the walls "],["1759.279","and we had our Bible school "],["1761.919","anyway and we saw God just move the Holy "],["1764.96","Spirit just just fall in those places "],["1767.32","one of our favorite teachings that we "],["1768.96","did was actually on blood Covenant and "],["1771.279","so that that was a pretty powerful time "],["1773.159","when we talked about blood Covenant so "],["1775.2","one of the young ladies that attended "],["1777.32","our Bible school she was um she was "],["1781.2","already uh she was already a Christian "],["1782.84","she had got saved through a different "],["1784.559","Ministry but she came to kind of level "],["1786.6","up her Bible knowledge at our at our "],["1789","Bible school and um just an awesome girl "],["1791.76","her mom was a witch doctor and her dad "],["1795.76","was involved in a paramilitary group gr "],["1798.679","uh that was there and so she she had a "],["1800.559","lot against her there was a lot of "],["1802.2","family stronghold she had to tear down "],["1803.919","in her life and she actually was a "],["1807.96","worship leader she became a worship "],["1809.48","leader for for her people there and she "],["1812.24","came to me and she said Jeff I want to "],["1814.08","do something nice for my for for my "],["1817.159","tribe uh and she's very artsy and things "],["1819.84","like that so she said can we have a "],["1821.36","budget to buy some materials and some "],["1823.799","paints and do some things for the tribe "],["1826.399","because I I want something to be a "],["1828.64","testimony about what God is doing "],["1830.44","amongst the tribe so I gave her those uh "],["1834.279","those things and in the same building "],["1836.559","that this Blood was smeared on the walls "],["1839.159","this is what she "],["1841.84","did she put the name of Jesus over her "],["1849.12","tribe that is a "],["1852","beautiful thing see the name of Jesus is "],["1855.84","a banner over us and that's that's what "],["1857.639","she told told me she said I I want this "],["1859.799","name to be declared amongst the tribe "],["1862.84","and so we've seen we've now been in this "],["1865.96","tribe about six years now we've "],["1867.48","literally seen the transformation the "],["1869.84","the pastor of of this tribe is actually "],["1873.08","the tribe he's actually the tribal "],["1874.48","leader he got saved in 2001 he was a "],["1877.88","young Christian and check out what he "],["1879.24","did nobody else in his tribe at that "],["1881.639","point knew Jesus he climbed the highest "],["1884.2","mountain in his baring guy in his area "],["1887.76","and and he began to pray and speak over "],["1889.88","his tribe and he said the Panay will "],["1891.88","know Jesus the panan will know Jesus "],["1894.519","they will know Jesus he began to declare "],["1896.36","it he began to declare that that the "],["1898.84","Next Generation would be Christians and "],["1900.76","he prayed that over 20 years ago and "],["1903.08","then when we showed up to help him he "],["1904.84","said this is exactly what I prayed for "],["1907.36","you see we see God moving amongst the "],["1912.08","tribes amen and "],["1915.519","so after we did the Bible study we now "],["1918.32","had the leadership that could be in "],["1919.84","place to do um to to open the Hope "],["1924.32","Center with one child and one child they "],["1928.12","they in our talks with them we said we "],["1930.279","don't they they they told us we don't "],["1933.44","know what you're doing but you're doing "],["1935.399","something really good really awesome "],["1938.279","this is

"],["1960.639","were put on but that's but but we we "],["1963.88","made up in our minds that God was not "],["1966.72","gonna be stopped and because of that we "],["1969.519","were able to open this

oppression in those "],["2523.56","areas is so strong you can literally "],["2526.72","feel it when you hit those boundaries "],["2529.52","you can feel it Josiah said it felt like "],["2532.44","something was literally crushing his "],["2534.52","heart that's how heavy those strongholds "],["2536.76","are in those areas but we've done prayer "],["2538.96","rides through all those things and we "],["2541","visited with Pastor w a couple times one "],["2543.92","of those times we went down and we were "],["2546.88","there already a one child Hope Center in "],["2549.119","an area that's somewhat close to there "],["2551.04","but not in the real danger area but they "],["2553.2","are ministering to Muslims and so we "],["2555.559","said okay we want to go and we want to "],["2557.559","learn from them we want to see what "],["2558.96","they're doing we want to get tips from "],["2560.68","them so that we know how to minister to "],["2562.2","Muslims and mother Muslim children and "],["2564.319","things like that so we go "],["2567.88","and we we show up at their Hope Center "],["2571.8","and on this side of the Hope Center "],["2573.079","there's a mosque and on this side of the "],["2575.119","Hope Center there's a mosque and right "],["2576.72","in between them is the Hope Center the "],["2579.68","one child Hope Center so we go in there "],["2582.68","and we meet the pastor who is a young "],["2584.48","man from one of the unreached tribes he "],["2587.64","got saved and now he's going back into "],["2590.64","his tribe sharing the gospel of Christ "],["2593.52","and what he did he brought out a Bible "],["2596.4","if we can show show those pictures this "],["2598.76","is a Bible in the Sama language it's "],["2602.44","very difficult to find and so he brings "],["2604.72","out this Bible and we're we're flipping "],["2606.72","through it it's in a rare language and "],["2608.88","and Pastor W holds that "],["2611.24","Bible and he says I've been looking for "],["2614.88","one of these for five years and have not "],["2617.839","been able to find it and we found that "],["2621.04","rare translation of the Bible in between "],["2624.839","two mosques come on God will use "],["2629.359","whatever he chooses whomever he chooses "],["2632.64","and he is active in the world today "],["2635.04","doing his thing God is on the "],["2639.96","Move let me share this with you one more "],["2644.24","story this is one of the unreached "],["2646.76","people groups in mindo it's called the "],["2650.24","mendan the mendan tribe now if you were "],["2654.28","to get on your phone on Google and you "],["2657.079","Google Menda now one of the first things "],["2659.24","that would come up would be something "],["2660.72","called the mendan now Massacre it's "],["2663.64","where the leader of of um "],["2667.72","he was a mayor at that point of that "],["2670.44","that operates where these people group "],["2672","are he killed all of his political "],["2674.24","opponents he killed the media that came "],["2676.8","with them 70 some people killed dug a "],["2679.2","big hole through all the cars all the "],["2681.04","bodies in it and that's life in mendan "],["2683.96","now this tribe the mendan is a Muslim "],["2688.359","tribe there's almost 1.4 million people "],["2692.48","0.1% Christian that if you do the math "],["2695.88","on that I think it's 100 38 "],["2698.72","138 Christians within that tribe that's "],["2703.76","crazy but God loves him and God is on "],["2707.48","the move and when we take limits off of "],["2709.8","God when we stop putting limits on God "],["2712.28","you see when when I was coming up and I "],["2714.88","was a I was a young person sitting in "],["2717.119","church I'd hear missionary stories and "],["2719","they would call they would call uh "],["2721.88","countries closed countries and you know "],["2725.64","to be honest with you there's no such "],["2727.24","thing as a closed country the gospel can "],["2729.119","go anywhere that it wants to go and God "],["2732","will go anywhere that he wants to go but "],["2734.04","what happens is when we start using "],["2735.8","language like that we in our minds we "],["2738.2","automatically think we can't go there "],["2740.72","and so that's what happens in these "],["2742.119","areas oh we hear their Muslim areas "],["2744.359","we're here they're dangerous we hear "],["2746.04","they're this we hear they're that and we "],["2747.8","set the limit and we say we can't go "],["2749.72","there but let me tell you something God "],["2752.24","is going there and the gospels are going "],["2754.52","there and and Pastor W and his nwork of "],["2757.52","missionaries are in these hardest to "],["2760.079","reach "],["2761.24","places and so right before I came there "],["2766","was one of the one of those missionaries "],["2767.839","that is operating amongst this tribe and "],["2770.559","he sent this text "],["2773.04","message this is what this is what he "],["2775.079","said today we Rejoice for the seven "],["2778.92","Souls of Muslims who follow Jesus Christ "],["2782.44","through baptism of our unity in prayer "],["2785.72","praise be to God seven Souls Heaven is "],["2789.319","rejoicing because seven "],["2791.68","souls in this area where there's only "],["2795.4","138 Christians in the entire tribe seven "],["2798.599","Souls came to "],["2801.92","Jesus imagine that heaven is rejoicing "],["2806.599","listen to what he says for three years I "],["2808.319","have shared the gospel of our Lord Jesus "],["2810.52","Christ with this family at times I felt "],["2812.839","that my efforts would be in vain and I "],["2814.839","was tempted to give up however the holy "],["2817.4","spirit of God encouraged us to continue "],["2819.44","loving them and sharing his blessings "],["2821.4","and his gospel with them so that they "],["2823.44","may become like us having faith and "],["2826.28","following Jesus Christ through "],["2829.88","baptism so I I followed up with this "],["2832.92","missionary and um I was talking with "],["2835.72","them in the in the network there and "],["2837.28","they said that's not the complete story "],["2839.64","what had happened is there were two a "],["2841.92","couple two people husband and wife that "],["2845.04","came to Christ through this "],["2847.68","missionary and one day they had a they "],["2851.16","had a dream at the same time same dream "],["2855.599","same time they woke up at the same "],["2858.319","time this was right after their "],["2861.52","conversion and here's what the dream was "],["2864.44","they had this dream that they were "],["2865.68","standing on top of a mountain and they "],["2868.4","were looking down and in the dream they "],["2871.319","saw all their family all their friends "],["2873.24","all their loved ones and they were "],["2874.96","trying to come up the mountain but they "],["2877.16","could never get up the mountain to where "],["2878.88","they were and so they looked around and "],["2881.8","in their dream they saw the "],["2884.72","missionary and they realized oh we're on "],["2887.52","top of the mountain because we know "],["2890","Jesus and Jesus has brought us to the "],["2892.64","top of this mountain so boom they woke "],["2896.4","up same time they had the same dream "],["2898.68","woke up at the same time and and just "],["2901.04","began to to pray and thank God for what "],["2904.2","he had done the next day they woke up "],["2906.28","they went through directly to that "],["2907.359","missionary and they said we want you to "],["2908.96","come and tell our friends about Jesus "],["2911.92","and he did he had the boldness to go and "],["2913.68","do it when he did that seven people gave "],["2917.4","their souls to the Lord then here's what "],["2921.24","not just that they they baptism is a big "],["2923.64","deal amen baptism is a deal they "],["2926.44","actually had to leave their area because "],["2929.119","it's so dangerous to do anything there "],["2931.079","they went to a safe area they traveled "],["2932.799","to a safe area and did the baptisms "],["2935.28","seven Souls "],["2937.24","were "],["2939.92","saved "],["2941.599","God is on the move and I want to "],["2945.4","encourage you guys to please join us in "],["2948.64","prayer and I would ask that you would "],["2951.599","that you would pray for "],["2953.599","Muslims pray for the Muslims in mind now "],["2956.599","pray for the unreached people groups in "],["2958.599","mind now right now it's their

would know the truth I'm "],["2971.2","telling you God is showing up we're "],["2973.4","hearing story after Story in the Muslim "],["2975.599","world where God is showing up in dreams "],["2978.52","and visions and so you might not see "],["2981.16","this on the media and it might not be on "],["2983.48","your Facebook feed or on Tik Tok or "],["2985.72","Instagram but God is moving and he is "],["2988.76","reaching the Muslims we are seeing God "],["2991.76","transform that so will you pray for the "],["2995.72","Muslims and "],["2998.48","finally I want to thank you "],["3002.04","all I want to thank you all from the "],["3004.319","bottom of my heart for being a part of "],["3008.079","this if you are a prayer Warrior for "],["3012.2","Faith Bible if you are a giver a tither "],["3017.559","if you are if you serve at Faith Bible "],["3020.28","these are your "],["3023.28","stories you're a part of this you're "],["3026.72","your giving your prayers have made an "],["3030.24","impact and I I want to thank you for "],["3032.72","that we have been on the mission field "],["3034.76","for seven years now Faith Bible has been "],["3037.76","with us since day one and you guys have "],["3040.799","been so good to us we've been able to "],["3042.44","bless other missionaries we've been able "],["3044.68","to to give above and beyond uh you know "],["3047.799","I I I always lean into the scripture "],["3050.359","I've never seen the righteous forsaken "],["3052.28","or his seed begging for bread and and "],["3055","that's we've lived that out in our lives "],["3057.359","we you guys have been so incredibly good "],["3060.079","to us but I'm asking if you will go with "],["3062.839","us just a little bit further what we're "],["3065.16","doing you know as the ministry grows it "],["3067.88","requires more it requires more prayers "],["3070.359","it requires more finances so if you can "],["3072.319","put up the final screen here's how you "],["3075.28","can get involved I want to tell you very "],["3077.04","simply how you can get involved if you "],["3079.359","want to be involved with with the Lord "],["3081","is doing uh in mindo and in other parts "],["3084.359","of the Philippines there's a couple "],["3086.119","things you can do one the first thing "],["3088","and foremost is you can pray you need to "],["3090.119","pray please be in prayer the whole "],["3092.48","situation with Emmanuel the only reason "],["3095.04","that happened is because we moved the "],["3096.68","heart of God with prayer and many of you "],["3099.079","stood with us in the middle of that the "],["3101.799","second thing that you can do is you can "],["3103.4","give and I want to start out by saying "],["3105.119","give to your church give to Faith Bible "],["3108.72","if you are not a tither I encourage you "],["3111.16","to be a tither that's very important the "],["3114.319","impact that you have through faith Bible "],["3116.4","is is felt throughout the world "],["3117.92","throughout your giving is very important "],["3119.4","that if you are not a tither that you "],["3121.64","seriously consider being a tither and "],["3124.559","that's not based on how much you make or "],["3126.359","how little you make or whatever tithing "],["3129.04","tithing is a very important thing and "],["3130.44","I'm telling you that when you do that "],["3133.559","it's not just Faith Bible that's going "],["3135.2","to get a blessing and missionaries "],["3136.559","around the world that's going to get a "],["3137.76","blessing it's actually going to be you "],["3140.64","that is going to unlock some serious "],["3142.64","blessing in your life and then finally "],["3145.28","the other thing you can do is you can "],["3146.559","can also choose to give to a missionary "],["3149.52","or a Ministry maybe your child uh child "],["3152.64","evangelism the brother was up here today "],["3155.079","they need funding for what they want to "],["3156.4","do give to that if you want to be "],["3158.839","involved in what we're doing you can go

that he "],["162.519","stopped working in my life entirely in "],["165.64","1990 um and I'm going to elucidate on "],["168","that for I don't know the next hour or "],["170.2","so what um but rather that at that time "],["174.599","the things he was doing were so in my "],["178.44","face that the IDE AA that it took me a "],["181.159","decade to finally turn myself over to "],["183.44","him um is "],["185.64","stupid no offense myself but I have to "],["189.319","call it what it "],["190.599","was "],["192.2","stupid but God used my stupidity to give "],["195.2","me a tool that I could use throughout my "],["197.799","Ministry the tales of my stupidity and "],["200.72","the knowledge I gained in my stupidity "],["204.56","became a tool as some will attest I have "],["207.519","a lot of stupid "],["210.72","knowledge Greg Ryan knows a lot of "],["213.72","stupid trivial stuff can I get a "],["219","witness but I've told that story before "],["221.12","so I'm going to move on as we after we "],["223.2","um moved down here to Southern "],["225.2","Maryland um a story I've also told so "],["228.04","moving on uh Wendy and I needed to find "],["230.4","a good church and to be entirely honest "],["233.599","I did not know what a good church "],["237.319","was I was saved in a cm so we looked for "],["240.879","one of those um but there isn't one "],["242.959","around here as a matter of fact um I "],["245.56","found that most people around here don't "],["247.12","know what a CMA "],["250.799","is Christian Missionary Alliance okay so "],["254.28","our first Sunday we went to a church I'm "],["256.479","not going to say which um and we left "],["259.12","mid service Wendy's choice because I had "],["262.079","no "],["264.52","idea it was a good "],["267.04","decision the following week uh we "],["269.84","thought we'd try something else we said "],["272.28","let's go non- denominational so we came "],["274","to "],["274.88","Faith and we've been here ever since uh "],["278.039","Wendy "],["279.039","mentioned that we were interested in "],["281.56","working with youth as she had been "],["283.12","involved in the youth program up in "],["285.24","cport Pennsylvania and I noticed she "],["288.28","chose to say we rather than I so I was "],["291.96","volen told that I would be serving with "],["297.36","youth God was beginning to do his "],["300.759","work for my soul now obviously now I can "],["305.36","look back and say that this wasn't "],["307.28","actually when God began the process but "],["309.759","this is going to be my jumping off point "],["311.28","because this is how I would begin to "],["313.28","serve and then to truly grow in my faith "],["316.039","and in my walk with "],["317.56","him about two weeks later uh the cooking "],["320.6","Ministry for visitors that we have here "],["322.88","showed up at my apartment to welcome me "],["324.72","to Faith except they didn't bring any "],["328.479","cookies "],["330.479","nor did they leave the car running as "],["333.199","they normally do no instead I was "],["336.56","grilled and now this is from my memory "],["339.12","by the way I don't know how severe the "],["340.88","gring was but to me it was "],["343.16","like um but believe me I do understand "],["347.28","why this happened anyway I was grilled "],["349.8","for four hours by the pastor and then "],["352.759","two other prominent figures of the "],["354.84","church now full disclosure 4 hours may "],["358.199","be an exaggeration "],["360.96","I have a weird habit of exaggerating by "],["364.8","one okay if there were five cars I'll "],["367.24","say six I don't know why I just do it "],["369.759","how many cookies you eat five I really "],["371.4","ate I don't know why I do that so it "],["373.88","might have been three "],["375.36","hours it did feel like "],["377.919","four point is it was a long "],["382.919","time "],["385.84","why Dick Neville always says well we "],["388.52","didn't know about you "],["389.919","GG to which I "],["392.28","reply "],["394.16","yeah but why did you "],["400.44","care it didn't make "],["404.599","sense well I finally figured it "],["408.599","out God had "],["411.28","plans now none of us were made privy of "],["414.36","those plans no one in that room knew "],["417.199","what those plans were but he had plans "],["420.039","plans to do something for my soul he "],["424.72","used dick Neva to somehow communicate to "],["427.12","me that something different from what I "],["430.28","was expecting from what anyone was "],["432.12","expecting was going to be happening was "],["435.52","already happening I had prayed up in "],["439.16","cers Port that God used me in whatever "],["441.36","way he saw fit when I was saved that is "],["444.199","a dangerous "],["447.08","prayer and I recommend it to "],["451.36","everyone he was using dick his "],["454.639","servant to plant the seeds in my soul "],["458.84","and I am forever indebted to dick for "],["461.12","listening to God's prompting when it "],["463.16","came to me when it came to the plans "],["465.36","that he had for my "],["468.84","soul and his plans for my "],["472.599","soul we're now going to intersect and "],["476.08","overlap with plans that he had for other "],["479.319","other people's Souls as "],["481.599","well Wendy and I started sitting in on "],["484.319","the teen Sunday school class um class it "],["487.759","was about six kids three families that "],["491","was out in the "],["492.4","trailer um that is a word that brings "],["494.639","mixed emotions for people who've been "],["496.639","here a while and I'm not talking about "],["498.84","the good trailers over here I'm talking "],["500.919","about the one that was over "],["502.879","there um I'll just say AP possum and "],["505.599","some of you will go okay all right "],["510.28","um anyway that class was led by Chris "],["513.8","misset and he sort of took me under his "],["515.68","wing for a few months and this was my "],["518.12","first real service opportunity God used "],["521.44","Chris to move me along in my faith and "],["524.039","my understanding and I am again indebted "],["526.76","to Chris for that when Chris moved on to "],["529.32","another church he serves in Gideons now "],["531.68","as well um I was volen told to start "],["534.36","teaching the Sunday school "],["536.36","class which in turn would then lead to "],["539.88","my next Ministry opportunity helping "],["542.8","Pastor Tim start fbc's first youth "],["547.68","group Tim would lead the group that "],["550.6","first year and when and I would assist "],["552.36","in any way we could games some teaching "],["555.56","building relationships with the kids "],["558.48","whatever and that word "],["561.48","whatever would sort of become my "],["563.519","catchphrase at that "],["565.2","point whatever you needed me to do just "],["567.6","tell me and I'll do it I'll do "],["573.839","whatever one summer day before youth was "],["576.48","about to kick off in its second season "],["579.519","Pastor Tim came to the Home Group I "],["581.279","attended at John Harris's house um I "],["584.32","assumed he was just looking to see how "],["586.32","home groups were going many of us had "],["589.079","young kids back then and they all "],["590.959","congregated in the basement or whatever "],["594.04","it's called when you go down three steps "],["595.48","and it shoots off the side of the house "],["596.92","I don't know it's not really a split "],["598.279","level but What's this called call it the "],["599.8","basement um the oldest Daniel who was "],["602.839","like six would kind of watch all the "],["605.44","kids and stuff cuz you know we're "],["609.32","responsible on this particular occasion "],["612.32","uh the kids were getting a bit unruly "],["614.519","and I was volen told by my wife and the "],["616.92","pastor that I was to go check on them "],["620.64","right now I should have seen through "],["622.12","that why would the pastor um elect me to "],["625.8","go but I'm not always the smartest "],["627.56","cookie in the flock "],["629.6","um when I got back there was a "],["633.24","noticeable I'll call it a "],["636.079","tension in the air um everyone was "],["639.279","looking at me all weird now I have "],["641.44","gotten used to that over the years but "],["643.32","it was different for some "],["645.839","reason I asked uh was I just volunteered "],["649.16","for "],["651.16","something and Tim affirmed that I was he "],["654.92","was heading out to be the aana commander "],["657.36","so I was volen told that I was the new "],["659.519","youth "],["661.36","leader and that started that now "],["664.92","understand at this point I was only on "],["667.959","the second year of my read the Bible in "],["670.279","a year "],["671.36","program right I wouldn't finish for "],["675.12","another two years probably finishing "],["677.92","ahead of schedule uh because I really "],["679.839","needed to know the Bible a little bit if "],["681.959","I was going to teach from it so there "],["684.56","was this urgency that I had to get this "],["686.639","one-year plan done faster than the six I "],["689.519","was on Pace "],["691.36","for and then God used "],["693.92","that urgency to again grow my "],["698.36","soul and again the growth of my soul was "],["702.8","going to have an impact on the growth of "],["705.48","other "],["706.8","Souls now because the leadership here at "],["709.24","Faith is not dumb and because they were "],["712.519","fully aware that I wasn't yet actually "],["715.2","very well grounded in the Bible and "],["717.88","because they were in tune with the "],["719.12","prompting of the Holy Spirit John Harris "],["722.16","uh would sit in youth with me to check "],["724.079","my theology make sure I wasn't going off "],["726.639","the rails teaching some weird "],["728.92","heresy and he would sit there with me "],["731.399","and I'd get on a roll talking about "],["733.12","something and something crossed my mind "],["734.8","I was like it's in the Bible it says "],["736.6","this and I talk about whatever it was "],["738.199","and I'm like I have no idea where it was "],["739.6","and then Jama go I believe that's in 1 "],["741.92","Corinthians 4 and then he pulls by and "],["744.279","I'm like what drop the I believe you "],["746.44","know where it is okay um "],["749.399","or I thought I thought John had the "],["751.6","Bible memorized forwards and backwards "],["753.92","and it was it was amazing "],["757.32","and yeah it was a lot of fun um but God "],["761.32","J God used John mightily in my life and "],["764.639","again I'm forever indebted uh to his "],["766.8","friendship to his guidance uh "],["769.36","particularly in my baby years I still "],["772.68","got the baby "],["774.76","fat God's done amazing things for my "],["777.199","soul through that man and it's an honor "],["779.839","to serve as an elder with them today but "],["782.399","that's jumping "],["784.12","ahead my next service opportunity came "],["786.88","when we decided to expand the worship "],["790.04","team God was still working on my soul "],["793.36","Bruce good pastor who played a standup "],["795.44","Bas in front of the stage remember those "],["798.519","things he was moving out of the area so "],["800.959","I said hey I play bass I have a "],["804.279","base now again full disclosure the words "],["807.56","play and "],["810.279","have we're kind of like when Abraham "],["813.12","claimed that Sarah was his "],["817.24","sister it's kind of "],["821.639","true kind "],["824.04","of I had taken two years of bass lessons "],["827.36","I had not picked up a Bas in 10 years I "],["830.72","knew how to play "],["832.88","exactly one song Stand By Me by Benny "],["837.759","King "],["839.6","that was my full "],["842.759","repertoire actually took little my my "],["845.6","wife was a kindergarten teacher she had "],["847.639","stickers with the letters I took the A "],["849.8","and the B and the C and I put them on "],["851.72","the fretboard so I kind of played by "],["853.639","color and every this is our worship team "],["856.32","this is what I "],["857.8","did it was "],["860","horrific okay I was not good I never "],["864.92","left the top two "],["866.6","strings ever might as well have taken "],["869.6","the bottom two "],["872.399","off and my brother he actually had my "],["876.72","base so when I said I had a base it "],["878.959","means I had bought one but he had it and "],["881.759","so I went and got it from him and it was "],["883.92","falling apart again he he plays and had "],["887.639","beaten it up and um so I I had a base "],["895","technically that's how I got on the "],["896.72","worship "],["897.68","team and this is where uh one day as we "],["901.519","were practicing the worship leader Dave "],["903.36","Carlson who drove down drove down from "],["905.839","north of DC every Sunday he turned to me "],["909.199","and he said Greg you're on stage now put "],["912.519","some pants "],["915.199","on that's a "],["918.279","quote that's the story of why I stopped "],["920.68","wearing shorts to "],["922.519","church now some of you will claim that I "],["925.279","still wear shorts to church and you are "],["927.759","surprised when you see me Dawning "],["930.319","fulllength pants but let's be clear if "],["933.279","you've never seen me play bass on a "],["935.04","Sunday you've never seen me wear shorts "],["937.44","to church on a Sunday what some of you "],["940.839","don't believe that it's "],["945.48","true it wasn't long before the rigors of "],["947.92","doing multiple Services due to the "],["949.519","growth spurt in the church was putting a "],["952","strain on the members of the worship "],["953.519","team and that forced us to create a "],["955.6","couple of "],["956.92","teams at first I was was on one team "],["960.16","singing and then I helped Mike Dunn lead "],["962.6","another team where I sang and played "],["964.36","bass G Munch sang we'll Tucker drummed "],["968.279","since I was playing bass and Mike played "],["971.04","guitar and sank Harmony the other team "],["973.399","had like 40 people but we got "],["977.92","four it was not "],["980.68","good oh the other three were "],["983.12","fine but it was not good I was not good "],["987.399","not not good at "],["990.279","all but here's the great thing God used "],["994.12","it God even blessed "],["997.72","it people would thank me for blessing "],["1000.36","them I'm like really I had the habit of "],["1003.8","making a mistake and going you know to "],["1006.079","announce it to "],["1010.24","everyone what he used it for though was "],["1013","he used it to bless my soul again I "],["1015.44","needed that I needed to get up there "],["1019.24","in 2009 things at chopticon where I "],["1021.639","taught English uh were getting worse "],["1023.56","than my bass "],["1024.72","playing so I resigned on June 30th and "],["1028.439","July 1st I started working here at the "],["1030.839","church as the Christian Ed "],["1032.72","director never saw that coming first "],["1035.839","order of business at my hire I was Vol "],["1038.559","and told to get the heck off the stage "],["1041.36","like the opening act at a monsters a "],["1043.039","rock concert you will never walk up "],["1044.88","there and play an instrument "],["1047.24","again my my musical career mercifully "],["1051.48","was brought to an "],["1052.919","end so what was I going to do well "],["1056.88","something possibly on par to my bass "],["1058.96","playing in my mind I was going to be in "],["1062.24","charge of children's "],["1065.64","programming I was even going to have to "],["1067.559","teach children not "],["1071","youth children like elementary school "],["1075.919","children Now understand when I was in "],["1079.12","college studying to become a secondary "],["1081.32","school teacher the Pennsylvania state "],["1083.52","school system has a policy that everyone "],["1086.159","in that program has to do in their "],["1088.039","professional sense PRM one half of it in "],["1091.72","a high school and one half of it in a "],["1094.039","middle "],["1095.08","school my professor violated that rule "],["1099.159","for the first time in over 30 years of "],["1102.679","teaching and he said this kid should "],["1106.52","never teach lower than 10 "],["1111.84","grade I may still be the only person in "],["1115.12","Pennsylvania state school history to not "],["1117.88","do part of their PRM in middle "],["1120.96","school and "],["1124.12","now when we didn't have enough "],["1125.919","volunteers to run multiple Sunday "],["1127.48","schools I created the kids church "],["1129.64","program where I would teach K through "],["1135.96","five children "],["1139.24","me now no no no no this is a bad idea "],["1144.84","but I strapped a puppet on my arm and I "],["1148.64","did "],["1149.36","it sometimes I strapped a puppet on both "],["1152","arms and I did it which makes it hard to "],["1154.28","turn "],["1156.72","pages then in the midst of that I "],["1160.159","started developing the Faith Bible "],["1161.799","Institute to teach Doctrine and church "],["1164.72","history and Bible interpretation and "],["1167.4","Gospel reading and a bunch of other "],["1169.4","stuff to adults who knew more of the "],["1172.48","Bible than I did people who are

year we "],["41.239","partnered with an organization called "],["42.719","good neighbors and they were gracious "],["44.719","enough to come up today to share what it "],["47.399","is the Lord's been

"],["327.639","that's half the reason I started good "],["329.199","neighbor "],["330.199","I wanted people to experience God at "],["331.96","work I wanted young people to gain "],["334.24","confidence and experience the joy of "],["336.08","serving Christ with their family and "],["337.56","friends and I wanted to know them to "],["339.759","know they can make a difference

"],["356.039","they hadn't figured it out yet I wanted "],["358.039","them to go home excited to serve in "],["359.759","their community and maybe even light a "],["361.759","spark that would uh cause them to do "],["363.84","something way bigger than what we were "],["365.84","doing and here's why that's important to "],["367.84","me I went on my first mission trip uh to "],["370.88","East Kentucky when I was 15 and it "],["373.08","changed my life I didn't know much about "],["375.44","construction and honestly I didn't know "],["377.4","if I'd be much help but I was we were "],["380.039","working on a house that had a broken "],["381.56","water line under it and the house only "],["383.8","sat about a foot off the ground and I "],["385.56","was small enough to crawl under it so so "],["388.72","my buddy and I got under there with the "],["390.68","flashlight found the broken pipe and we "],["393.199","came out and our chaperon told us how to "],["395.16","fix the pipe went under there we did it "],["397.16","yay they had water and then we needed to "],["399.84","insulate the attic and the only way to "],["401.759","get into this attic we had to climb up a "],["403.36","ladder to like the peak of the roof pull "],["405.08","out this little gable vent we shoved "],["407.44","ourselves in and they shoved the "],["408.96","insulation in and we got the job done um "],["413","but yeah we learned a lot overcame a lot "],["415.879","of fears did a lot of grunt work but by "],["417.919","the end of the week I didn't want to "],["419.8","leave none of my buddies wanted to leave "],["421.8","the family we helped was so grateful "],["423.56","they were in tears as they told us how "],["425.199","cold their house had been last winter "],["427.199","and how excited they were to have "],["428.639","running water and insulation and I "],["430.759","realized I could use my two hands to "],["433.12","help people in need when I left to go on "],["435.4","that trip I was a kid going on an "],["438","adventure with my friends and I felt "],["439.52","like when I was coming home I was a man "],["441.16","with a purpose and so for the next three "],["443.96","years my summer mission trips to "],["445.479","appalache for the high point of my year "],["447.879","then I did what You' do after you "],["449","graduate High School you put all your "],["451.12","energy and focus into college and work "],["453.84","and I worked hard studied hard graduated "],["456.12","kumade got the job I wanted with a great "],["458.24","salary and at 26 felt like I had "],["461.039","accomplished everything I set out to do "],["462.96","I had a nice house flashy car great "],["465.68","truck a sailboat on the inter Coastal a "],["467.68","nice savings account and the weather was "],["470.68","beautiful I uh I lived in Minnesota I "],["472.96","moved to West Palm Beach Florida for "],["474.599","college so every day I felt like it was "],["476.039","a tropical vacation to me but something "],["479.56","was missing and I I felt deep down empty "],["483.28","and without a purpose and I didn't think "],["485.08","any amount of success or Sunshine was "],["486.96","going to fix that feeling so I prayed "],["489.319","that God would give me contentment and "],["491.96","give me a purpose and I also really "],["493.879","wanted to experience him working the way "],["495.639","that I felt him working during the "],["497.08","mission trips when I was a kid so I "],["499.08","prayed for that "],["500.639","too couple months later I found out the "],["503.039","organization I volunteered with as a "],["505.159","teenager uh was in desperate need of "],["507.8","Summer Staff writers to go around they "],["510.199","had four states and a bunch of sites "],["512.159","that they were doing and they wanted "],["513.44","people to interview the families and uh "],["516.12","and the volunteers that they were "],["517.24","working with and so I I thought about it "],["520.719","but it was a 10- week commitment 10 "],["523.08","weeks off of work would uh be pretty "],["525.959","rough so I couldn't decide and then "],["529.04","shortly thereafter they called up and "],["531.32","said you know are you going to do it we "],["533.279","have three positions available nobody's "],["535.2","taken any of them no prospects so I "],["537.08","decided to do it I thought okay I'm "],["539.68","going to go out there I'm going to have "],["541.04","a good time um I'm going to uh go back "],["544.92","feeling content and there we are but it "],["548.399","didn't go exactly like that so after a "],["551.48","few weeks the novelty wore off and I "],["553.56","started getting depressed because it "],["554.92","seemed like every house we went to you "],["557.12","had this situation where it's a old "],["558.959","dilapidated home it was a grandparents "],["560.8","home grandparents you know you got the "],["562.519","grandpas that were tough guys you know "],["564.279","they worked in the mines they did "],["565.519","logging they did all this kind of stuff "],["567.24","then you get their kids and they're "],["568.8","living off the government and then you "],["570.48","got the little grandkids who are super "],["572.92","cute and fun and lovable but when you "],["575.48","like ask them what what do you want to "],["576.959","be when you grow up they don't say I "],["578.16","want to be a race car driver I want to "],["579.68","be a doctor I want to be a pilot they "],["581.56","say I want a four-wheeler like my "],["583.36","neighbors got you know I want a big "],["585.399","house I want a like a monster truck you "],["588.44","know they were saying things like that "],["590.48","not what they wanted to be and I was "],["592.399","like oh no this situations not ever "],["594.76","going to change the cycle of poverty was "],["597.36","kind of overwhelming and yeah we we were "],["599.32","helping them stay warm safe and dry "],["601.16","which is a great thing but I felt like "],["603.6","we were putting Band-Aids on wounds that "],["605.24","needed "],["606.2","stitches so then six weeks in I went to "],["609.32","interview a family we were helping in no "],["610.839","kill West Virginia and I knew right away "],["613.279","something was different the couple "],["614.8","seemed to have like hope and excitement "],["616.519","in their eyes and I wondered why they "],["619.04","lived in this old one-bedroom trailer "],["621.32","that had had water leaks that destroyed "],["623.64","the ceiling destroyed the floor um they "],["626.64","had like water and all their light fixt "],["629.12","years half the outlets in the house "],["630.519","didn't "],["631.36","work and uh the whole family was they "],["634.519","had a three-year-old son and a the "],["636.76","daughter was like 6 months old and they "],["638.44","all slept in the same room because it "],["640.16","was the only bedroom and the only room "],["641.56","in the house where they didn't have to "],["643.04","dodge Holes in the "],["644.76","Floor so I wondered why they seem so "],["647.04","happy and optimistic and I asked him "],["649.48","well the husband tells me he had been "],["651","working as a cook at Burger King and he "],["653.88","had just got a job at Cracker Barrel so "],["655.92","he's cooking at Cracker Barrel extra "],["657.44","Buck an hour and he's got four 1K and "],["659.56","he's pumped I'm getting pumped too and "],["661.279","then his wife chimes in she goes yeah "],["663.279","when I was uh pregnant with our daughter "],["665","I got my CNA certificate she had been "],["667.24","working at the uh hospital as a "],["669.16","receptionist part-time now they give her "],["671.32","full-time still minimum wage but she had "],["673.32","health insurance so she's excited and I "],["676.04","thought finally we're going to fix their "],["677.68","home add a room with their new jobs "],["679.959","they've got a good future ahead of them "],["681.639","I can't wait to write the story and they "],["684","said by the way though will you please "],["685.6","not tell your organization about our new "],["687.8","jobs I said why not and they said "],["690.92","because it would disqualify us from "],["692.88","assistance I was like you got to be "],["694.639","kidding so I went to check around I "],["696.72","thought they had the info wrong and they "],["698.36","were right to put them just above the "],["700","line um for the income criteria we'd be "],["702.399","able to uh we'd be able to help so I "],["706.36","didn't write the story and uh it was a "],["709.88","bummer but a month later when the summer "],["712.2","was ending I went back to see that "],["713.6","family just to check in how things had "],["715.56","went and everything was done in their "],["718.12","house but they were way more excited to "],["719.68","show me this little handicap ramp over "],["722.079","on their neighbors trailer and uh I said "],["725.079","yeah what's what's the story with it "],["727.079","they said well before you guys helped us "],["728.72","out we had saved 600 bucks to work on "],["731.079","our home and since ours is all fixed you "],["734.36","their neighbor was a disabled vet and "],["735.8","needed a ramp they said we paid a guy to "],["737.48","go and do it and I was like wow okay "],["740.279","that's the group of people that God's "],["741.88","calling me to help "],["744.48","um I wanted them to keep you know with "],["747.079","that group I wanted to help them "],["749.399","have them do what that family did keep "],["750.92","paying it forward and uh wanted to "],["754.48","empower them to become givers so that's "],["757","the second half of the reason I started "],["758.399","good neighbors to show working poor "],["760","families in Appalachia that God loves "],["762.12","them by bringing a crew of people to "],["763.92","work on their homes nobody else was "],["766.12","helping them because again having a "],["767.8","full-time job even at minimum wage puts "],["770.199","them over the income criteria for other "],["772","nonprofits and government programs in "],["774.56","our area I thought they're kind of like "],["776.279","the traveler in the Good Samaritan story "],["778","they got mugged "],["779.48","the Samaritan was the only one that was "],["781.079","ready to help and it's a good thing he "],["783.279","did or that traveler probably wouldn't "],["784.88","have made such a speedy recovery if he "],["786.88","recovered at all with the families that "],["789.12","we help most are so close to the line "],["791.36","that paying to fix a leaky roof might "],["794.32","mean they couldn't afford to pay their "],["795.68","monthly bills on time so then fees are "],["797.68","racking up and let's say the washing "],["799.32","machine breaks so they're getting a "],["801.399","payday loan to fix it at a high interest "],["803.24","rate then their car battery dies they "],["805.079","miss a day of work pretty soon they're "],["807.199","in a downward spiral if they don't fix "],["809.72","the roof same situation destroys their "],["811.92","ceiling destroys their floors house gets "],["813.68","moldy and the family gets sick so "],["816.519","they're in a pretty vulnerable state I "],["819.56","also realized early on that another "],["822.279","threat to these families was none of "],["824.88","them were saving for these "],["827.6","emergencies so it it just wasn't it it "],["830.92","wasn't part of the culture planning for "],["832.519","the future "],["833.959","um and what we decided to do to fix that "],["837.68","was we teamed up with an organization "],["839.56","The Institute for economic freedom and "],["841.24","we did a customized five- session "],["843.079","Financial training course to uh uh that "],["847.079","they're required to take before we work "],["848.68","on their home and it teaches them how to "],["850.48","both save money and keep it so the gist "],["853.32","of it is everybody weighs five bucks a "],["854.88","day it doesn't matter who you are um "],["857.04","here's some examples pack a lunch for "],["858.839","work make coffee at home and put it in a "],["860.72","thermos order water instead of soda if "],["862.839","you eat out at a restaurant cut back or "],["864.92","cut out cable TV Etc when you save five "],["868.32","bucks by pack in your lunch take the "],["870.079","five bucks you would have paid the "],["871.16","cashier at McDonald's and put it in a "],["873.279","jar the end of the week they bring their "],["875.279","jar to the class and share how they "],["877.36","saved and everybody gets excited about "],["879.199","this uh we had this family uh the husers "],["882.44","James and Vanessa they're the parents "],["885.12","they were competing so they had their "],["886.56","jars and they're trying to save as much "],["888.24","as they can and then they got their "],["889.279","little kids coming in and one of them "],["891.199","had like a jar that said ice cream "],["892.92","another one had a bike fund you know and "],["896.199","it was it was neat it was a big deal "],["899.56","because um they had never saved before "],["902.36","and when I saw James at Walmart a couple "],["904.56","years after that I I said you guys still "],["906.639","doing that he goes oh yeah we've got a "],["908.12","jar for vacation fund we've got a car "],["910.279","fund we've got all sorts of all sorts of "],["913.04","jars so it was pretty cool but the goals "],["915.68","of the that we lay out in the course are "],["917.32","the first 250 bucks are the family's "],["919.959","investment they've got to have some skin "],["921.399","in the game we might spend $10,000 on "],["923.6","their house but the 250 is at least an "],["926.24","investment in uh in their then after we "],["930","fixed their house their goal is to keep "],["931.88","saving until they save up 1,500 bucks in "],["934.68","an emergency account in case the washer "],["937.319","does break or the heater goes out or the "],["939.319","water heater goes out um that way they "],["941.6","don't have to go and get a high interest "],["943.24","loan or pawn something to uh take care "],["945.279","of it and it's a pretty easy sell "],["947.56","because without fail someone will come "],["948.88","into the class their head down tail "],["950.68","between their legs jars empty and say my "],["953.16","water heater went out and I just had to "],["954.8","have hot water for the kids and we say I "],["957.839","understand that's why we're doing this "],["960.079","program so the next time you're "],["962.8","prepared at the end of the class we tell "],["965.079","them what we expect from them after we "],["966.56","fix their homes we tell them each year "],["968.72","we can only help out about 30 families "],["971.639","but what if each of you helped out just "],["974.199","one family we've doubled our impact uh "],["976.92","you know you could if your neighbor's "],["978.56","car battery goes out and they can't "],["980.199","afford a new one and you help them maybe "],["982.24","they won't miss a day of work if each of "],["985.199","the or let's see and that resonates with "],["987.24","them people in East Kentuck are giving "],["989.92","people and it makes my day when I see "],["991.92","one of these people at Walmart that's "],["993.68","that's where everything happens at "],["994.88","Walmart it's like our only "],["996.48","store when I see them there they talk "],["998.759","about how they help somebody else it's "],["1000.68","just like the icing on the cake I love "],["1003.12","it "],["1004.8","um we also talk extensively about "],["1007.68","tithing and how God blesses you when you "],["1009.36","give them 10% so we stress they also put "],["1012.839","10% of their paycheck in a jar so "],["1015.199","they're not tempted to spend it after "],["1017.04","that um "],["1019.24","and to illustrate this at the end of the "],["1021.399","class uh we have each family take $25 "],["1024.4","out of the $250 they on their jar "],["1026.6","towards their house and as a class they "],["1028.88","decide a place to give it together and "],["1031.76","uh this gets them pump because they then "],["1034.439","see themselves as "],["1036.24","givers we've had a big impact on the "],["1038.679","families we've helped several have made "],["1040.24","the decision for salvation because our "],["1042.079","work help them realize

I'm "],["1137.24","going to highlight um and I'm really "],["1139.2","going to try and communicate what the "],["1140.559","heart of our ministry is but before I "],["1143","get into that I do want to Jo show a "],["1144.76","quick kind of overview of the impact "],["1146.48","we've had so far so we've taken three "],["1149.2","trips uh we've had 81 Faithful Servants "],["1152.039","attend those

"],["1181.76","projects that have all varied in scope "],["1184","but they're all quite "],["1185.64","big if you go next we've served five "],["1187.96","local families so last year we did "],["1190","Christmas in April we had 18 folks join "],["1191.919","us in our local community to to do a "],["1194.12","project uh and we've helped various "],["1196","church members and their extended "],["1197.36","families with with with various home "],["1198.96","repair "],["1199.88","efforts and through all of this we've "],["1202.44","brought one gospel message as Jason "],["1204.919","highlighted in the video we've used "],["1206.52","construction as a means to share the "],["1208.48","gospel of hope and love with families "],["1210.48","who are desperate need of both and "],["1213.039","that's what we're going to focus on "],["1214.2","today the heart of this ministry which "],["1216.72","is to share the love of Jesus with "],["1218.28","everyone we "],["1219.84","encounter and so the next few slides you "],["1222.039","all will see are kind of just visual "],["1223.84","representations of the trip and what "],["1225.44","we've done so they'll be going in the "],["1226.799","background uh but I won't be talking "],["1228.559","much to the pictures so you can go next "],["1231.52","so first we want to create a servant's "],["1234.24","heart specifically with our youth we're "],["1237.6","looking to give our youth a chance to "],["1238.919","get involved to put their faith into "],["1240.919","action to give them an opportunity to "],["1243.52","understand what service looks like "],["1245.36","demonstrating how we can use the gifts "],["1247.12","we've been given and how to share the "],["1249.919","gospel with everyone that we encounter "],["1252.4","we bring adults alongside them to "],["1254.039","encourage them every step of the way not "],["1256.559","only teaching them how to use tools and "],["1258.28","develop useful skills but sharing "],["1260.52","spiritual Direction guidance along the "],["1264.32","way during the week we give them "],["1266.48","specific jobs that they're responsible "],["1268.52","for so they feel empowered to take "],["1270.88","ownership we allow them to run our "],["1272.88","evening devotions giving them time to "],["1275.2","read time and space to read scripture "],["1277.799","and to answer questions for themselves "],["1280.039","and to lead us in prayer we're giving "],["1282.559","them every opportunity to learn to grow "],["1284.64","to live out their faith and to truly "],["1286.6","serve others for the first time in an "],["1289.96","environment that is safe and we believe "],["1292.64","that experience will change their "],["1294.559","hearts and the reason we believe that is "],["1297.039","that's how this whole Ministry started "],["1299.36","22 years ago a High School freshman took "],["1301.96","a trip with Appalachia service project "],["1303.64","to Kentucky to make homes warmer safer "],["1305.64","and "],["1306.84","drier in that one week trip planted a "],["1309.48","seed of service that has continued to "],["1310.96","grow to this day throughout high school "],["1313.24","she took two more trips with ASP one to "],["1315.08","West Virginia one to Tennessee she then "],["1317.52","took two International trips one to "],["1319.08","Honduras and one to Mexico running "],["1321.159","weeklong vbss in those communities once "],["1324.08","she got to college she began finding "],["1325.559","other ways to serve running local toy "],["1327.72","drives and coat drives for families down "],["1329.52","there and on summer and winter break she "],["1331.799","would serve with young life as a Young "],["1333.159","Life "],["1334.279","leader upon graduation of college she "],["1337.159","decided to take a "],["1338.6","two-month um position with an "],["1341.24","organization called orphanage Outreach "],["1342.919","in Dominican Republic she went there to "],["1345.919","help build a local orphanages or AG "],["1349","build curriculum for their upcoming "],["1350.6","school year and to act as a host for "],["1352.84","shorter term Mission groups that came in "],["1354.44","for the week coming out of college she "],["1357.4","became a full-time Young Life leader "],["1359.24","Early Childhood educator and helped run "],["1361.24","a Sunday school class here at Faith for "],["1362.919","a few years fast forward to today she's "],["1365.36","a full-time mom with three beautiful "],["1366.919","kids and she's the Lead Teacher in our "],["1368.84","two to three-year-old classroom "],["1370.159","downstairs using the gifts she's been "],["1372.24","given to raise up the children of Faith "],["1374.159","Bible Church and for those of you who do "],["1376.679","not know who I'm talking about yet "],["1377.799","that's that's my wife Lauren and I don't "],["1380.039","share this to tuck up all of her "],["1381.32","accomplishments and all the things she's "],["1382.679","done I bring them up to illustrate this "],["1384.559","is what a heart of service does we "],["1387","believe as you grow your heart grows and "],["1390.44","as you serve your heart "],["1392.52","grows when you PL a seat of service it "],["1395.52","grows throughout your entire life it not "],["1397.679","only leads to your faith maturing and "],["1399.32","strengthening it leads to others Faith "],["1401.44","maturing and strengthening and it can "],["1403.279","lead to generations of families being "],["1405.279","impacted and so our prayer in this "],["1407.48","aspect of the ministry is to plant those "],["1409.799","seeds of service to cultivate those "],["1412.159","seeds that we would be worthy Disciples "],["1414.6","of our youth and that as we mature and "],["1416.799","we grow we do not grow weary and "],["1421.039","serving area "],["1422.919","two second area is to strengthen the "],["1425.799","community amongst our body of Believers "],["1428.679","scripture is very clear that the "],["1429.96","Christian walk is one that needs to be "],["1431.559","done in community and we believe these "],["1433.84","trips offer you a great opportunity to "],["1435.72","strengthen that "],["1436.88","community this trip gives you a real "],["1438.919","opportunity to know your brothers and "],["1440.279","sisters outside of a quick Sunday "],["1441.72","morning chat when you spend 6 days 144 "],["1446","hours 8,640 minutes with people you "],["1449.4","really get to know them when you're "],["1451.84","sharing in common experiences common "],["1454.44","challenges and common successes you are "],["1457.08","forming bonds that strengthen over "],["1459.32","time this trip also gives folks an "],["1461.48","opportunity to learn what gifts they've "],["1462.919","been given all throughout the week folks "],["1465.52","are encouraged and challenged to step "],["1467.08","outside of their comfort zones with the "],["1469.52","understanding that they have a team full "],["1470.64","of brothers and sisters supporting them "],["1472.279","every step of the way when we are "],["1474.679","surrounded by other believers we are "],["1476.88","empowered in our faith we are reminded "],["1479.72","that we are important and that we are "],["1481.96","needed as the part of the body of Christ "],["1484.72","and the body will not Thrive or be fully "],["1486.88","healthy without our "],["1489.36","contribution we're also looking to build "],["1491.36","the community of Believers in the "],["1492.679","communities that we're serving trying to "],["1495.08","strengthen their faith through our "],["1496.76","actions and so finding an organization "],["1499.52","that we can partner with in the long "],["1501","term is such a blessing in this aspect "],["1503.2","of the ministry knowing that we will be "],["1505.44","working with Jason and Summer and the "],["1507.52","rest of the Good Neighbor staff for "],["1508.76","years to "],["1509.88","come knowing that we'll visit some of "],["1512.2","the same homes year after year get to "],["1514.52","see the homeowners year after year "],["1516.799","really gives us an ability to strengthen "],["1519.08","and build the body of Believers not only "],["1521.12","here locally at Faith but more "],["1524.2","globally and so our prayer in this "],["1526.76","aspect of the ministry "],["1528.24","is that the body of Believers would be "],["1529.76","grow would grow stronger we would take "],["1531.96","our eyes off of ourselves and we would "],["1533.799","see the needs of others we would "],["1535.96","encourage each other to discover their "],["1537.679","gifts and to give them opportunities to "],["1540.36","do "],["1544","so and now for the real heart of this "],["1547.64","ministry sharing the "],["1549.84","gospel so while those two other areas "],["1552.559","are important sharing the gospel is the "],["1555.279","most important whether that's with the "],["1557.44","home home owners were serving or the "],["1559.399","staff members were working with in these "],["1561.2","organizations or other community members "],["1564.12","our goal is to share Christ's love with "],["1565.76","everyone we "],["1567.12","encounter we can help meet folks "],["1569.2","physical needs all day we can make their "],["1571.559","homes warmer safer and drier but if "],["1574","we're not meeting their spiritual needs "],["1576.159","if we're not intentionally sharing "],["1577.72","Christ's love with these folks we are "],["1579.679","working in vain and so what does sharing "],["1582.36","the gospel look like on these trips I "],["1584.84","have two "],["1586.039","stories so first two summers ago we went "],["1588.799","to Beattyville Kentucky and part of the "],["1590.799","trip included a running a "],["1592.679","VBS where a small group of folks who "],["1594.919","were working on homes in the morning "],["1596.6","left that job site to go to a local park "],["1599.48","and to minister to kids in the "],["1601.679","area and so we spent many months leading "],["1604.12","up to this trip preparing getting ready "],["1606.36","going through our skits getting the um "],["1608.76","crafts and everything just right and "],["1611.2","expecting to have about 15 to 20 kids a "],["1614.159","day um ranging from third grade up to "],["1617.2","Middle school and so the first day we "],["1619.919","get to the park we're super excited we "],["1621.64","get there early to make sure we're "],["1623.08","prepared we got the music we got the "],["1625.64","crafts and we're thinking 12:45 1:00 "],["1628.84","floods of kids are just going to come "],["1630.279","run into the park and we're going to be "],["1632.039","we're going to get to minister to "],["1633.64","them so as we're sitting around talking "],["1636.64","time slowly ties by no kids show "],["1639.96","up around 2 o'l finally a car pulls up a "],["1643.72","family gets out a young husband and a "],["1645.96","young wife and two young kids "],["1648.039","I think the kids were three in just over "],["1649.48","a "],["1650.48","year so we uh we introduced ourselves we "],["1653.52","talked to them we played with the kids "],["1654.88","for a little bit but as the end of the "],["1656.96","first day kind of wound down we realized "],["1659.24","the VBS was going to look a lot "],["1660.6","different than what we thought it was "],["1661.679","going to and Ministry is often like that "],["1665.64","but that didn't stop the Lord from using "],["1667.039","this small team to minister to the folks "],["1668.559","of that "],["1669.519","Community from Tuesday on we had two "],["1671.76","families show up each day one family was "],["1674.519","a wounded veteran with a wife with the "],["1676.12","two young kids we had met on Monday "],["1678.159","who were struggling to make ends meet he "],["1680.48","had just taken over a local VFW chapter "],["1682.919","and he was doing everything he could to "],["1684.44","bring that group back to life and to "],["1686.6","support his fellow veterans but life was "],["1689.799","hard another was an older grandmother "],["1692.12","whose own children were having a number "],["1693.64","of challenges and so she was now "],["1695.679","essentially raising grandchildren she "],["1697.279","had not planned on raising in "],["1699.24","retirement and for 4 days our team got "],["1701.559","to know these folks they got to listen "],["1703.679","to their stories they got to hear about "],["1706.039","the hurt and the heart and the pain that "],["1708.08","they were "],["1709.12","experiencing they got to give them a few "],["1711.2","hours of much needed relief every "],["1713.519","afternoon but most importantly they had "],["1716","an opportunity to share about a God that "],["1717.88","loved them they got to pray with them "],["1720.36","and over them they got to pray for their "],["1723.08","children they got to share their stories "],["1725.72","their hurt and how God had been faithful "],["1727.64","through those things they got to share "],["1730.24","the Gospel of Jesus Christ with these "],["1732.6","folks and for the Second "],["1735.96","Story So for most of you who you know "],["1738.44","Bobby Joy he's on the left here he's the "],["1741.32","husband of Margaret Joy the father of "],["1743.159","the four kids Tor Connor Montana and "],["1745.32","Garrett he was our church treasurer and "],["1747.72","he was my "],["1748.72","uncle this was the first trip we took as "],["1751.08","part of this ministry summer of "],["1753.799","2021 and three months before three short "],["1756.32","months before this trip Bobby was having "],["1758.88","in the hospital having most of his "],["1760.24","esophagus removed he had been diagnosed "],["1762.64","with cancer a number of months before "],["1764.159","that and had gone through a number of "],["1765.799","treatments and procedures leading up to "],["1767.48","a "],["1768.2","surgery and so originally Bobby had not "],["1770.519","planned on coming on this "],["1772","trip but the Lord had different plans "],["1774.12","for "],["1774.84","Bobby roughly two weeks before the trip "],["1777.84","we had two folks drop out due to "],["1779.24","schedule conflicts so that prompted me "],["1781.679","sending an email out to the church "],["1783.12","asking for folks to fill "],["1786.08","in Bobby quickly called me after that "],["1788.44","email went out and I'll try to do my "],["1790.72","best Bobby impersonation here but it's "],["1792.2","not very "],["1793.64","good he said hey got your email uh I "],["1797.76","probably won't be much help but I'd like "],["1799.559","to go and I'm like Bobby you sure yeah "],["1802.96","I'm sure I'll be all right and so that "],["1805.36","was it Bobby was coming on the "],["1808.399","trip so before we left I ended up "],["1810.6","shuffling the teams around a little bit "],["1812.159","to make sure Bobby was on my team "],["1814.2","because i' been around Bobby most of my "],["1815.72","life and I knew two things he was going "],["1818.039","to work really hard and push himself and "],["1820.6","he could be a bit "],["1822","stubborn so I wanted to be on his team "],["1824.24","simply to make sure he wasn't pushing "],["1825.72","himself too hard "],["1827.84","but this trip looked a lot different for "],["1829.279","Bobby than it did for everyone else he "],["1831.48","still could not eat full meals so that "],["1834.279","meant he just s snacked throughout most "],["1835.88","of the day he could still not lay flat "],["1838.64","when he was sleeping so he had his C "],["1840.24","with this like wedged thing that propped "],["1842.2","him up um but that meant he really "],["1844.279","wasn't sleeping all that much and he had "],["1847.039","a number of other physical ailments that "],["1849.519","really kind of made this trip more "],["1851.48","difficult for him than it did for anyone "],["1853.12","else but still he pressed on and he "],["1855.24","served joyfully and without knowing what "],["1857.72","he had been through you never would have "],["1859.639","known Bobby had any anything wrong with "],["1861.72","him so Monday morning rolls around we "],["1864.76","load our truck up we get our materials "],["1866.399","and we head out to the job site upon "],["1869","getting to the homeowner site site I got "],["1872.08","what I can only explain as the warmest "],["1873.96","welcome I've ever received which was you "],["1876.6","guys got that shot yet wear your mask at "],["1880.32","and this was Miss Sheila she had moved "],["1882.799","back home after a few year a few years "],["1884.48","ago after retiring from being a bus "],["1886.12","driver in New York to take care of her "],["1887.72","elderly father who also worked at lived "],["1889.679","at the "],["1890.6","home so she had real concerns about Co "],["1893.96","and we were the seventh group of "],["1895.2","strangers visiting her that week so she "],["1897.919","had no idea where we were coming from or "],["1899.76","what sicknesses we were bringing with "],["1902.2","us and so because of that all the work "],["1904.44","we were doing on this trip was outside "],["1906.36","no one was permitted to go inside not "],["1908.279","even to use the "],["1909.84","bathroom so we had a good conversation "],["1912.279","we introduced ourselves and we got to "],["1915.279","work but each day SE Sheila became more "],["1917.96","comfortable with us being there and so "],["1919.76","she spent more time with us outside "],["1921.639","talking about her life sharing her story "],["1923.96","getting to know us her brother hoot "],["1926.36","lived just down the street and he would "],["1928.08","join us on the site most days as well "],["1931.159","but Bobby and Sheila really hit it off "],["1933.279","Sheila was a noons tell you everything "],["1935.559","she was feeling take it or leave it kind "],["1937.32","of person and Bobby loved it Bobby would "],["1940.919","hit her back with a quick oneliner or a "],["1943.2","well I'm not sure about that and she "],["1945.12","would always point to him and say I like "],["1946.559","him "],["1949.44","as the week went on Sheila began joining "],["1951.039","us for our lunchtime devotions she got "],["1953.2","to hear about us as we testified to how "],["1955.399","the Lord was moving in our lives the "],["1957.519","things he was doing she would chime in "],["1959.559","every once in a while and share a little "],["1960.919","bit about her life but as the week went "],["1963.44","on her and Bobby began talking a lot "],["1965.279","more about Bobby's recent Health battles "],["1968.24","the things he had went through and some "],["1970","of the challenges involved with "],["1971.799","them and I'll always remember instead of "],["1974.039","focusing on how hard it had been Bobby "],["1976.44","always used it as an opportunity to give "],["1978.12","thanks to the Lord Bobby shared it "],["1980.559","shared how he used it as an opportunity "],["1982.24","to read scriptures to the nurses as he "],["1983.919","was laying in the hospital bed with "],["1985.279","nothing else to "],["1986.36","do and Bobby would talk about his desire "],["1988.88","simply to serve the Lord "],["1991","more so Thursday rolls around now I'm "],["1993.919","walking around the job site just to kind "],["1995.32","of see how everyone's doing I do two "],["1997.519","laps around the house and I don't see "],["1998.96","Bobby and so I'm thinking he's in the "],["2001.039","woods doing his business or he'd passed "],["2003.84","out somewhere behind a truck and we "],["2005.2","didn't see him he comes walking out of "],["2007.799","her house and I'm like Bobby what are "],["2010","you doing man you know you can't be in "],["2011.32","there we've talked about it all week and "],["2012.48","he's like no no no it's good well it "],["2014.76","turns out michila had invited Bobby into "],["2016.44","her house to show him her family Bible "],["2018","and to read him her favorite Bible "],["2020.72","verses Thursday night I get back to the "],["2023.36","center I'm going down to take a shower I "],["2024.84","see Bobby in the um it was like a men's "],["2028.08","locker room so he's in the bathroom "],["2030","scrubbing his hat in the sink I'm like "],["2032.44","Bobby what are you doing he's like well "],["2035.039","whoot really likes this hat and so I'm "],["2036.48","going to clean it up and I'm going to "],["2037.44","give it to him and so he did Friday "],["2040.12","morning comes around Bobby gives hoot "],["2043","his hat you can see hoots in the back "],["2044.639","here in the second picture he's got "],["2046.2","Bobby's hat on but that's not how that's "],["2049.04","not all that happened on "],["2050.599","Friday Friday ended with Bobby standing "],["2052.96","on Miss Sheila's porch reading out "],["2054.839","scriptures that he had used to get "],["2056.119","through his surgeries reading Bible "],["2058.359","verses that he had been praying over to "],["2060","get through his recent "],["2062.119","battles so as you can see here Bobby was "],["2064.599","the first to jump on a ladder climb 20 "],["2066.919","feet in the air measure some siding he "],["2069.399","happily climbed on the roof in 100° heat "],["2071.599","to roll out tar paper to shingle the "],["2075.839","house he often yelled at our younger "],["2078","team members for stealing his pencil or "],["2080","measuring from the wrong side of the "],["2081.8","board but that wasn't the reason Bobby "],["2084.04","Joy came on this trip it wasn't to push "],["2086.72","through those long days of physical pain "],["2088.96","hurting more than any of us really knew "],["2091.24","to finish the siding or to complete the "],["2093.839","roof he came on that trip to share his "],["2096.24","story and to witness not only to Sheila "],["2098.64","and Hoot but to everyone that attended "],["2100.599","that "],["2101.359","trip he came on this trip to tell of "],["2103.599","God's faithfulness even when we don't "],["2105.96","understand why we Face the battles that "],["2107.32","we "],["2107.96","do he came on this trip to live out the "],["2110.32","words James gave us to consider it great "],["2112.359","joy whenever we experience various "],["2115.8","trials and so circling back to the local "],["2118.28","VFW family um they invited us out to "],["2121.28","their local VFW one of the nights we "],["2122.92","were on the trip and so we went um a lot "],["2125.48","of their Community m MERS were there "],["2127.359","with their families and so we decided to "],["2129.52","do our worship our prayer time and our "],["2131.4","devotions at the community center with "],["2133.359","them um so we did our worship and we "],["2136.079","ended our worship and they asked one of "],["2137.92","the community members asked if he could "],["2139.24","play some worship songs and if we would "],["2140.72","join him in doing that and so we have a "],["2143.24","video of "],["2155.8","that "],["2157.319","the "],["2184.07","[Music] "],["2185.72","20 "],["2193.01","[Music] "],["2206.8","and so as many of you know Bobby Joy has "],["2209.28","flown "],["2210.16","away later in the year we got home Bobby "],["2213.96","went back into the hospital and began "],["2215.319","fighting in affection and in early 2022 "],["2219.079","Bobby was called home to be with our "],["2220.92","Lord and so two years removed from this "],["2223.4","trip there are things I'm not certain "],["2225.56","of I'm not certain if Miss Sheila's roof "],["2228.119","is leaking in other areas I'm not "],["2230.76","certain if hoot has given himself to the "],["2232.92","Lord I'm not certain of all the impacts "],["2235.28","this trip has had but there's one thing "],["2237.92","I am certain of I'm certain that when "],["2240.72","Bobby Joy is in the presence of our Lord "],["2242.839","and savior he heard their words well "],["2245.56","done good and faithful "],["2248.16","servant and so that's what these trips "],["2250.16","are all about it's about meeting people "],["2252.52","where they are trying to use the gifts "],["2255","that we've been given to meet their "],["2256.2","physical needs in some cases giving them "],["2258.839","the hats off our head to let them know "],["2261.16","that they are loved that they are "],["2263.359","valuable and that they have a god that "],["2265.319","is longing to be in a relationship with "],["2267.119","them and so our prayer in this area of "],["2269.44","the ministry is that when the homeowners "],["2270.92","look around and they see a roof that is "],["2273.28","no longer leaking or a floor that is no "],["2275.52","longer caving in they won't see us they "],["2278.16","won't see our faces they'll see a God "],["2280.52","that loves them and is longing to know "],["2282.04","them a Shepherd searching for them and "],["2284.76","rejoicing with his friends and Neighbors "],["2286.8","when that one lost sheep has been found "],["2289.28","a father running to them with open arms "],["2292.079","to greet them with a hug and a kiss when "],["2293.64","they return "],["2295.079","home and so brothers and sisters in "],["2297.24","closing I simply want to encourage you "],["2298.8","all to find ways to live out your faith "],["2301.839","whether through this ministry or any of "],["2304.2","the other great Ministries we have here "],["2305.52","at Faith Bible Church "],["2307.319","I simply want to encourage you to use "],["2308.92","the gifts you've been given to

should be or we can get "],["2346.359","involved we can live out our faith we "],["2349.44","can share Christ's love in our community "],["2351.88","in Paintsville Kentucky and to the ends

"],["37.16","finishing so uh speaking of "],["40.64","prayer verse one says that this is a "],["44.079","prayer and you can check your own "],["45.96","footnotes as I'm not going to attempt to "],["47.92","pronounce that last word there um point "],["51.039","being habach calls this his prayer using "],["54.879","the third person in that first line "],["56.64","which we think is a really cool thing to "],["58.6","do uh we used to to do that in high "],["60.68","school when we used our nickname to "],["62.44","refer to oursel uh but Greg digresses um "],["66.72","using the third person in first verse "],["69.119","one before rolling back into uh third "],["72.439","first person in verse "],["74.159","two oh Lord I have heard the report of "],["77.759","you and your work oh Lord do I "],["80.92","fear in the midst of the years revive it "],["83.88","in the midst of the years make it known "],["86.52","in Wrath remember Mercy "],["91.479","now this verse is probably the extent to "],["96.079","which this book this chapter of the book "],["100","uh can be called a prayer if you ever "],["101.64","taught children knowingly and with "],["104.159","intent because we've all taught "],["105.759","children's stuff through our words and "],["107.84","our actions and our example whether we "],["110.52","intended to teach them or not um keep "],["113.88","that in mind when you're doing whatever "],["117.079","uh you know what I'm talking about you "],["118.56","may have attempted to teach them how to "],["121.28","pray and Mike threw this up there "],["124.119","already although the a the way I learned "],["126.84","it was different um my wife "],["130.959","subversively taught me this uh she "],["133.8","directed it at my children but I was a "],["135.44","new believer so she always did it when I "],["137.36","was in earshot so this is what I learned "],["139.12","as well um the acts method of praying "],["142.36","you start The Prayer by IGN knowledging "],["144.44","God could say adoring God but "],["146.44","acknowledging him as father as king as "],["148.92","Creator as Sovereign Lord etc etc you "],["152.68","move to confessing doesn't have to be in "],["154.599","this order just complain it confessing "],["156.4","your sins Define those things for which "],["159.319","you know you need to repent and then "],["162","repent of those things of which you just "],["165.4","confessed one should also offer up "],["168.159","Thanksgiving for the love and blessings "],["170.08","that you have already received from your "],["171.72","creator king um even some of those you "],["173.599","haven't received yet and then of course "],["175.08","for the Forgiveness you've received from "],["177.599","your Sovereign father for all those sins "],["180.239","you just "],["181.44","repented of that you were apparently um "],["184.519","and actually this the ones that you were "],["186.12","apparently too busy to notice uh that he "],["188.4","was doing for you you ingrate um don't "],["191.799","be an ingrate um offer up Thanksgiving "],["196.04","to God finally there's supplication "],["198.44","supplication is a fancy word that is "],["200.319","used in this because it starts with an S "],["203.08","um so it fits nicely with the acronym "],["205.28","but it basically means respectfully ask "],["208.2","for Stuff "],["210.519","okay but Act is hard to say so we go "],["214.4","with the S of Supplication these are all "],["216.84","components by the way of the Lord's "],["219.04","prayer that he taught to his disciples "],["221.48","when they asked him how they should pray "],["224.08","in Luke 11: "],["227.12","2-4 Jesus says to them when you pray say "],["231.12","father Hallowed Be Your Name Your "],["232.879","Kingdom come give us each day our daily "],["234.72","bread and forgive us our sins for we "],["236.799","ourselves forgive everyone who is "],["238.959","indebted to us and lead us not into "],["246.36","temptation right okay um this has those "],["251.879","elements at least implied I think that "],["255.319","Thanksgiving part isn't directly stated "],["258.32","uh but in that like we've forgiven "],["260.44","others line he sort of suggests that the "],["263.24","ability to forgive others is actually a "],["265.88","gift of God that results from accepting "],["269.68","Christ but I don't want to dwell too "],["271.479","much on that let's go back to habach "],["274.24","here's the prayer he stands in awe or "],["278.68","fear respectful "],["281.96","fear of the Lord of The Sovereign Lord "],["285","of his power he confesses sort of that "],["288.12","they deserve the Wrath that is to come "],["290.84","he sort of side doors the Thanksgiving "],["292.759","thing like Jesus did noting that all of "],["295.639","those awesome things that he God has "],["298.12","done was out of mercy and Grace and "],["301.199","kindness and love and for that habach is "],["304.919","thankful and then he respectfully asks "],["307.52","supplicates God to remember those who "],["309.84","have not abandoned God who have remained "],["314.12","faithful in these Unfaithful times that "],["317.12","absolutely deserve his wrath and as to "],["320.16","please show them "],["322.639","Mercy by doing a bunch of stuff like he "],["325.44","God has done in the past to show Mercy "],["328.12","on the faithful and even sometimes on "],["330.84","the a bit too "],["333.639","Unfaithful God is even merciful on them "],["336.12","sometimes so from "],["337.4","here the book or this chapter of the "],["340.24","book reads more like a "],["342.44","Psalm and because it uses the language "],["345.12","of the Psalms we know that it was "],["346.72","probably actually used as a Psalm which "],["349.639","can sometimes be prayers uh but this is "],["351.88","more like a Psalm of Promise a Psalm of "],["354.4","praise and of commitment on the part of "],["357.36","the author who represents the nation "],["360.52","and thus also all "],["362.759","believers so the remainder can "],["364.8","realistically be broken into two parts "],["368.52","part one is from verse three to verse 15 "],["371.68","and is simply habach recounting "],["374.479","remembering the report that he habach "],["377.84","has heard the Lord's Fame as translated "],["382.12","in a couple of versions uh his Fame "],["384.599","about his mighty "],["386.319","acts this again report of what he's done "],["390","his deeds his work that's mentioned in "],["393.12","verse two this is probably when they "],["394.759","read the Scrolls to everyone this was "],["396.639","the report after they found them after "],["399.479","Josiah it's also a "],["401.8","celebration of those acts an honoring of "],["405.56","the god that's actually capable of "],["408.44","pulling them off and it's a reminder to "],["411.88","habach and then Israel and then all "],["414.199","believers that God is more than capable "],["418.4","of saving them either "],["420.919","from or "],["423","through the punishment that's coming "],["427.12","possibly even both at least to some "],["430.199","degree part "],["433.12","two is verse 16- 19 this is the lesson "],["438.28","that habach and hopefully Israel and "],["440.879","hopefully we as Believers have learned "],["443.919","through this Oracle about what's a "],["447.24","common them for them us for us us and "],["451.039","yes understand habach has learned the "],["455.319","lesson the faithful among them have "],["458.16","learned it at this point but like the "],["460.72","story I told last week about my "],["462.879","professor lowering my grade because I "],["465.479","angered him by not doing a project and I "],["468.84","understood and I I learned the point but "],["472.039","I still got my grade "],["475.039","lowered Israel is going to be pounded by "],["479","Babylon "],["481.599","on this is how the lesson will very "],["484.639","literally be hammered "],["487.599","in I know you get it now but I'm going "],["491.319","to drive it "],["493.08","home we'll get to that first let's look "],["496.199","at the first part now not going to dwell "],["498.479","on this it's going to take me a while "],["500.12","but I'm not dwelling uh we have the "],["502.159","advantage of having copies of the Bible "],["504.52","that we can carry around and read "],["506.479","whenever uh but I do want to look at it "],["509.56","to help us remember that we serve a "],["512","powerful God and to remind you that even "],["515.839","though he doesn't manifest himself to us "],["518.32","in this dispensation post crucifixion as "],["521.2","he did in habach dispensation prec "],["524.92","crucifixion he does still guide us and "],["528","manifest himself in us through his Holy "],["532.32","Spirit who has tabernacled in our very "],["536.44","Hearts okay I say this because I'm not "],["539.88","going to say anything necessarily deep "],["541.64","at the beginning here and most of what "],["543.519","I'm about to say um if you have a really "],["545.8","good study Bible your footnotes probably "],["547.959","say something along the same lines um so "],["551.04","not you know creating anything huge here "],["554.12","but just kind of explaining what he's "],["555.68","talking about we're going to start at "],["556.839","verse "],["558.24","three oh and just to sum up before we "],["561.2","start we get a lot and I mean a lot of "],["565.079","imagery from The Exodus particularly in "],["568","this section all right so if you know "],["571.12","your Exodus story some of these should "],["573.04","pop out by the way you really should "],["574.76","know the Exodus story because it's "],["576.079","referenced all the time in the Old "],["578.72","Testament and the new all right so verse "],["582.079","three God came from tamon and the Holy "],["584.92","One from Mount parin saah that's a "],["587.959","musical term we don't know what it means "],["590.04","all right so uh his Splendor covered the "],["592.68","heavens and the Earth was full of his "],["595.72","praise now habach uses typical very "],["599.48","common Middle Eastern Hebrew imagery of "],["602.76","the manifestations of God and "],["604.519","particularly his power and His glory "],["607.2","here you got chariots on thunderclouds "],["609.519","surrounded by a Heavenly Host uh hurling "],["611.959","lightning and dumping rain causing "],["613.76","floods below mountains to shake maybe "],["616.12","some landslides tossed in I mean why not "],["618.56","um so this Splendor and all of this "],["620.56","these are what the the arrows and things "],["622.44","coming this is lightning bolts all right "],["624.88","very common from the time moving on "],["627.64","verse four his brightness was like the "],["629.64","light rays flashed from his hand "],["631.48","lightning and there he veiled his power "],["634.399","before him went pestilence and plague "],["636.68","followed at his heels so verse five "],["638.839","references pestilences and "],["641.079","plagues both are recognized at the time "],["644.12","as instruments of divine judgment and "],["646.2","divine "],["647.76","punishment perhaps best exemplified in "],["651.36","Egypt but also elsewhere throughout the "],["654.399","Bible depending on your version you "],["656.44","might see the words plague and "],["658.04","pestilence in changed uh you might see "],["660.399","the word destruction thrown in there "],["662.12","instead um it doesn't matter it kind of "],["665.12","works anyway they all have the same "],["668.399","implications verse six he stood and "],["671.6","measured the Earth he looked and shook "],["673.76","the Nations then the Eternal mountains "],["676","were scattered the Everlasting Hills "],["678.8","sank low his were the Everlasting wavs "],["683.12","as I noted earlier God's "],["685.48","presence the manifestations of his glory "],["688.56","are often accompanied by earthquakes and "],["693.079","landslides time and time again we see "],["695.68","the forces of nature actually crying out "],["698.6","announcing the

often put "],["69.84","to music the music itself is not the "],["73.72","song the lyrics are there's no such "],["77.24","thing as a song without lyrics now we've "],["80.84","misapplied this term to like "],["86.36","birds but the idea that they're "],["88.439","conveying a message or even speaking a "],["90.799","language is implied when we do this so "],["94.32","my point still kind of stands and I've "],["97.24","now dwelt on this for far too long last "],["99.6","week we read habach second complaint to "],["102.64","the Lord and that he habach did not like "],["106.719","the way God was punishing Israel for "],["109.68","sins and indiscretions that he habach "],["112.64","had just complained about going "],["115.399","unpunished when we last Saw habach not "],["118.2","literally he's been dead for aever very "],["120.039","long time uh he was standing waiting to "],["122.84","get his smack from God his God Smack if "],["127.32","you will in response to his habach "],["130.959","complaint this week we're going to look "],["133.04","at God's response much in the same way "],["138","we looked at habach his complaint uh "],["141.48","which means I'm going to stop a lot I "],["144.04","heard some comments that I've been "],["145.72","easier to follow while preaching through "],["148.36","this book habac than I have been on "],["151.319","previous books and I think that's "],["152.519","probably because I'm stopping to fill in "],["155","information as I go along rather than "],["157.319","reading the entire thing but "],["158.599","occasionally going that's interesting um "],["162.12","and then just reading the whole passage "],["164","so whatever the case I have some "],["166.36","preaching to do so let's stop all this "],["167.879","reminiscing and idle chitchat and let's "],["171.08","get down to some reading "],["173.72","now I'm going to read from the ESB V "],["178.08","because I pretty much always do but we "],["180.72","have some obscure Hebrew phrases here "],["184","that are difficult to translate uh "],["186.239","because there aren't a great deal of "],["188.159","sources that contain some of these words "],["191.48","at least not Hebrew sources uh so this "],["194.159","should be fun for most people it "],["197.2","probably won't be but it should be so "],["200.159","let's leave it at that habach chapter 2 "],["202.76","we're going to start at verse two and "],["206.68","the Lord answered me write the vision "],["209.36","make it plane on tablets so he may "],["212.799","run who reads it now here's our first "],["215.879","example in today's reading of figurative "],["218.319","language and sometimes obscure language "],["219.879","a word used in a Way Beyond its "],["222","dictionary definition in a manner that "],["224.4","the audience would have understood "],["226.04","that's a bit more difficult for us in "],["228.4","today's world who have cell phones and "],["231.08","computers and such remember when iPods "],["234.28","were new tech that everyone "],["238.4","needed I bought my son one for 600 bucks "],["242.799","and a week later it was "],["245.04","obsolete cuz cell phones came out and "],["248.04","now you have like every song ever like "],["250.84","right "],["253.84","there anywh "],["256.88","who God says to carve the vision the "],["259.84","Revelation the Oracle on tablets in such "],["262.84","a manner that quote he may run who reads "],["267","it the NIV says so that a heral "],["270.16","may run with it this is why I made the "],["273","cell phone comment makes a little bit "],["275.16","more "],["276.8","sense we don't use Harolds "],["280.759","anymore the nasby says that the one who "],["283.56","reads it may run which is closer to the "],["285.84","ESV but no clearer to us uh but they "],["288.6","have two footnotes that I'm going to get "],["290.039","to in a second and the csb reads so one "],["292.16","may easily read it nothing about running "],["295.84","there the aforementioned nasby footnotes "],["298.8","um when read together would render this "],["303.12","that one may read it fluently who is to "],["306.08","Proclaim it a better better English "],["309.039","grammar version of that that whomever is "],["311.24","to Proclaim it may easily read it and "],["313.52","understand it and help those to whom he "],["314.84","proclaims it get it more easily too much "],["318.479","like the csb "],["319.88","said and if you're wondering what that "],["321.84","abbreviation is that's Greg Ryan "],["323.639","amalgamation of Bibles he used in this "],["325.8","study and I slam them all "],["328.479","together "],["332.72","so the "],["334.6","point God wants there to be no "],["337.08","misinterpretation of what he's saying "],["339.319","even though he uses terms sometimes "],["342.639","poetically it's actually very often the "],["345","poetic use that makes the depth of what "],["347.6","is being said more clear and what I just "],["351.36","said should become more clear as I go "],["353.52","along well let's find out if that's true "],["355","continuing with verse "],["356.36","three for still the vision awaits its "],["359","appointed time it hastens to the end it "],["362.039","will not lie if it seems slow wait for "],["365.199","it it will surely come it will not delay "],["369.16","we made it another verse all right we're "],["371.28","rolling boy howdy we're going along all "],["373.919","right let's do that thing we did with "],["376.08","the previous verse the ESV says for "],["378.72","still the vision awaits its appointed "],["382.44","time it hastens to the end it will not "],["385","lie the NIV for the Revelation awaits "],["389.199","and appointed time it speaks of the end "],["392.16","and will not prove false the nasby again "],["394.24","with footnotes but I'm going to put them "],["395.8","in the brackets this time for the vision "],["397.72","is yet for the appointed time it hastens "],["401.319","or pants interesting uh toward the goal "],["406.56","and it will not fail or will not lie csb "],["409.639","for the vision is yet for the appointed "],["413.039","time it testifies about the end it will "],["416.039","not lie two things here first the "],["418.4","underline "],["420.4","Parts

traitors and remains "],["300.199","silent when the wicked swallows up the "],["302.639","man more righteous than he interesting "],["305.28","thing here people today ask this very "],["308.72","question to question the validity of the "],["311.8","Bible and even the existence of God "],["315.12","thinking that they're being clever or "],["317.12","something that they've have

really did you really just have to "],["358.84","ask that question kind of funny and I "],["361.12","say this because he just asked the very "],["363.6","question in his first complaint he asked "],["366.599","in verse three why do you idly look at "],["371.199","wrong now some people a little bit of a "],["373.88","tangent here we take the English of "],["376.24","verse 13 and then make an inaccurate "],["379.8","statement about God that I just quickly "],["382.639","want to deal with habac calls God you "],["386.8","who cannot look at wrong "],["390.16","you who cannot look at evil people will "],["392.88","say that God is actually incapable of "],["396.96","looking at "],["399.759","evil that is a false "],["402.36","statement that is not what it says here "],["405.759","if that were true he couldn't have "],["407.639","looked at and spoken to Satan in Job 1 "],["410.44","6-12 and say have you considered my "],["413.44","servant job he's looking right at the "],["415.8","Devil who's "],["417.8","evil he would have had had to close his "],["420.199","eyes and hope that he just hit the two "],["422.879","cities he was hurling sulfur at and "],["424.96","stuff as lot and his wife were walking "],["426.68","away cuz he wouldn't have been able to "],["428.12","look at those "],["429.879","cities and I'm going to tell you right "],["432.12","now if that were true about God he "],["435.199","certainly couldn't look at "],["438.16","me and I'm going to guess he couldn't "],["440.599","look at you "],["444.68","either habach just accused him by the "],["447.8","way of looking at wrongdoing so that "],["451.639","cannot be the meaning of those "],["454.319","words so then what does it mean well the "],["457.639","Hebrew word with its accusative grammar "],["459.72","thing there don't worry about it means "],["461.319","cannot endure to see and that's why "],["465.8","habach is asking God why he is enduring "],["470.12","it why are you enduring this evil so "],["473.879","back to what I just said I'm add so just "],["475.4","follow me um habach just asked a "],["477.84","question in verse three why do you idly "],["481.479","look at "],["482.96","wrong and in that verse he was referring "],["485.319","to the rich and the powerful and Israel "],["487.879","who are getting rich off of the abuse "],["490.4","and the exploitation of the poor in "],["496.759","Israel now he asks why do you idly look "],["501.52","at "],["503.36","traitors literally the Hebrew says "],["505.84","dealers treacherously in "],["508.24","treachery I think kind of hammers in the "],["511.599","the the message there they're "],["513.08","treacherous okay it's fun grammatical "],["515.399","construction I'm an English nerd um but "],["517.719","he says you look idly at Traders and "],["519.839","remain silent now this is an interesting "],["522.719","word that is actually used in a poetic "],["525.24","sense here it literally literally means "],["527.6","to plow or engrave or cut in but in the "],["531.279","specific sense that it's used here it "],["532.959","means to exhibit silence and it's almost "],["537.079","exclusively used of men there's only "],["541.12","three instances in the Old Testament "],["543.48","where it's used of God and every time it "],["545.64","is used of God it's in regards to God's "],["549.6","permittance of evil or his exhibiting "],["554.04","silence as evil is "],["557.079","occurring side note I thought I made up "],["559.279","the word permittance there but I looked "],["560.92","it up it's real so anyway um Isaiah "],["566","42 for a long time I have held my PE "],["569.24","peace I have kept still that's the word "],["572.48","I'm talking about and restrained myself "],["575.399","that's why I'm keeping still I'm "],["576.959","restraining "],["579.12","myself now I will cry out like a woman "],["582.839","in labor I will gasp and pant I will lay "],["585.519","waste mountains and hills and dry up all "],["587.88","their vegetation I will turn the rivers "],["590","into islands and dry up the pools that's "],["592.839","what happens when he stops remaining "],["594.56","silent and then we see again in Psalm 50 "],["598.04","if you see a thief you God speaking you "],["601.24","are pleased with him and you keep "],["602.72","company with adulterers you give your "],["604.88","mouth free reign for evil and your "],["606.56","tongue frames deceit you sit and speak "],["609.6","against your brother you

sitting by and doing "],["633.8","nothing because that's what you're doing "],["635.8","oh no no no no I'm just showing a little "],["637.76","bit of "],["640.519","patience you want me to "],["643.399","speak no you don't and of course here in "],["647.959","verse 13 in habach he finishes his "],["650.959","question why do you idly look at "],["653.079","traitors and remain silent when the "],["655.04","wicked swallows up the man more "],["657.88","righteous than he well that's an "],["659.8","interesting question who is the man that "],["663.519","is more righteous "],["665.2","than "],["668.68","whom well if the second one is of course "],["671.839","I think we identified it the Babylonians "],["674.12","as they're the ones doing the so-called "],["676.279","swallowing up at least in the sense "],["678.079","habach means it even though if you read "],["680.16","the next verse where I told you not to "],["682","continue reading last week you kind of "],["683.88","read that it's the Israelites who would "],["685.56","literally be swallowing their countrymen "],["689.639","but again I "],["692","digress habach is calling Israel the man "],["696.68","or the men more righteous than the "],["700.44","Babylonians but didn't he just get done "],["704.48","complaining to God because God wasn't "],["707.76","punishing Israel for disobeying

"],["733.079","else's oh at least I'm not D "],["738.519","huh God's "],["740.519","eyes oddly enough habach actually "],["743.92","already has his "],["745.6","answer those two passages the ones that "],["748.04","were up there "],["751.04","they predate habach little "],["753.72","complaint they came first and since he "],["756.48","was prophesying in Judah at the very "],["759.32","earliest towards the end of Josiah's "],["761.88","Reign and Josiah had just led a Revival "],["765.8","in 623 BC where they found the book of "],["768.199","the law and they read it out loud to "],["771.32","everybody "],["774.12","everybody for weeks so everyone heard it "],["778.48","all I mean come on you just heard some "],["781.44","of these "],["783.72","things but I guess a lot can happen in "],["786.04","18 "],["787.12","years and like I said last week we is a "],["790.88","forgetful Critter isn't "],["793.88","we 18 years we can forget very "],["798","quickly there is an end to God's "],["802.399","patience and when God's patience ends "],["805.92","woe to all let me stress that wo "],["809.32","to "],["811.36","all because God's Wrath is what follows "],["815.24","and God has shown repeatedly and vividly "],["817.68","in the last book of the Bible Revelation "],["819.76","but also throughout the Bible he will "],["821.92","often use nature or simply things within "],["824.44","the creature within his creation to "],["827.199","carry out his "],["829.759","wrath sometimes he used the Israelites "],["833.36","as the instrument of Wrath against other "],["835.16","nations but sometimes he uses those "],["837.56","other nations "],["839.44","against "],["840.48","Israel sometimes he uses those other "],["842.839","nations against each other and it "],["845.839","doesn't seem like he's involved at all "],["848.48","but he "],["850.44","is but what we have to "],["853.279","remember is that if you ask God to put "],["856.639","an end to Injustice

"],["1685.279","because it really fits here so I'm going "],["1686.48","to tell it again um when I was at "],["1688.44","Shippensburg University not the one I "],["1690.32","got kicked out "],["1691.48","of uh this was before I became a "],["1693.919","Christian I had a six credit teaching "],["1696.72","class it was my proem before I went into "],["1699.279","student teaching um I was

have a bad attitude um so I "],["1753.64","calculated my "],["1755.2","grade because I'm That Kind of a jerk "],["1758","and I realized that even if I took a "],["1760","zero on this major project I would still "],["1763.12","have enough for an "],["1764.84","A so I didn't do it like I don't have to "],["1770.48","do this thing this thing's dumb I don't "],["1772.279","want to do it so then I got

"],["39.48","there was a book in the Bible called "],["40.52","habach be "],["41.84","honest yeah "],["45.399","whatever anyway um little bit about "],["48.96","habach we do know he's probably a "],["50.68","contemporary of Jeremiah um a book we're "],["53.239","probably all familiar with Rob did teach "],["55.039","it to us for two or three um decades so "],["57.879","we should be good "],["60.92","uh he's one of the so-called Minor "],["63.039","Prophets because his book is only three "],["65.239","chapters long so if you're like me and "],["67.4","look for it like this stop it go to the "],["69.439","table of "],["70.439","contents um and if you do that you can "],["72.799","start at Matthew and work backwards and "],["76.36","that would be quicker um he probably "],["78.6","lived in Judah at the end of Josiah's "],["80.759","Reign beginning of jeho Kim's Reign he "],["83.159","wrote this prophecy somewhere around "],["85.759","605 BC he probably lived to see at least "],["90","the initial fulfillment of his prophecy "],["93.079","one might say unfortunately if you're "],["95.399","familiar with the Prophecies of Jeremiah "],["97.079","and the Minor Prophets um there is a "],["101.56","legendary apocryphal text called Bell "],["104.399","and the dragon it's not history it's not "],["108.119","inspired some people do consider it to "],["110.04","be the 14th chapter of the Book of "],["112.36","Daniel but it's a completely different "],["114","writing style it's a different theme um "],["116.64","I'm going to say it's just it's not it's "],["118.159","not Daniel um anyway contained in it is "],["122.479","a scene where habach ministers to "],["125.64","Daniel's needs as Daniel is in the "],["128.84","Lion's Den but I think that kind of "],["130.72","undermines the whole point of Daniel "],["132.879","being in the Lion's Den um and so "],["135.92","actually again it's just Legend So it "],["137.84","gives us no more information about our "],["139.519","author um so thanks for that Greg that "],["142.44","was completely useless so now the book "],["145.76","um habach was very popular during the "],["149.2","400 30-year inter testamental period uh "],["152.4","meaning the time between our Testaments "],["155","between the close of the Old Testament "],["157.04","and the opening of the New Testament "],["159.08","Malachi 46 the Old Testament end um that "],["162.4","was written in 430 BC and then the Book "],["165.159","of James uh was written somewhere in the "],["167.599","mid-40s possibly ad. 50 um you could say "],["171.76","the first event of the new testament "],["173.36","which was John the Baptist birth birth "],["176.28","somewhere around 6 BC um of course we'd "],["179.28","be forgetting in the beginning section "],["180.959","of John when I say that but um anyway or "],["183.879","you could just say from Malachi to "],["185.879","Matthew either way here's the point "],["189.48","again useless information there were "],["191.76","about 430 years between the old and the "],["194.72","New Testament where there were no "],["196.519","prophets there was no inspired scripture "],["199.519","um writings and the Book of habach was "],["202.519","really really popular that's my point so "],["205.08","welcome to that there's four minutes "],["206.44","gone now why was it popular well I think "],["210.12","because among the prophetic writings "],["212.799","this book is a bit unique and that it "],["215.879","really includes no messages addressed to "],["219.56","and therefore none that "],["222","condemn Israel at least not directly and "],["226.239","they probably like that what the book is "],["229.439","is a dialogue between the prophet and "],["232.239","God where the Prophet actually argues "],["235.64","with God and the way that he God does "],["238.56","things the way he goes about his "],["240.04","business so to speak okay habach his "],["244.84","wrestling with God again so to speak "],["247.84","represents the voice of The Godly that "],["250.36","were living in Judah on the brink of "],["252.84","Destruction from neop Plasser and "],["255.84","Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonians and thus "],["258.88","it probably served also as the voice of "],["261.959","those godly people in that inter inter "],["264.84","testamental period who were under "],["268.12","foreign occupation at the time "],["269.759","eventually that foreign occupier being "],["272","Rome in the promised land the land God "],["274.72","had promised them it can also serve as "],["277.84","the voice of godly people the church "],["281.4","living in our dark modern world who all "],["284.8","struggle and have all struggled to "],["287.08","understand and to comprehend God's ways "],["290.919","forgive the phrasing in light of that "],["294","darkness that is surrounding us now this "],["297.639","book is written in a way that it appears "],["299.96","as a sort of lurgical piece um used "],["302.8","during worship it's not unlike some of "],["304.52","David's Psalms and we will look at some "],["306.4","of David's Psalms so it it really opens "],["309.199","itself up to use by us in like "],["312.52","situations regardless of the original "],["315.52","situation in which it was written like "],["318.36","you don't have to be living in a cave "],["320.72","running from a murderous King to get "],["323.24","something out of Psalms 27:57 and "],["326.759","142 we can still learn truths from that "],["329.8","and we can still use them same with "],["331.16","habach we're all going to walk through "],["333.08","habach verse by verse and we're going to "],["335.72","look at the prophet's complaints because "],["338.44","that's what he's doing through this book "],["340.8","he's "],["342.16","complaining and we might even join him "],["345.24","in his complaining and we might found "],["347.68","our find ourselves saying yeah anyway "],["350","about that God I was wondering the same "],["353.84","thing well fortunately God gives us "],["357.199","answers so let's turn to the B book of "],["360.08","habach if you haven't already done so it "],["362.6","is in the New Testament no it's not it's "],["365.52","in the Old Testament sorry the number 92 "],["367.919","made me say "],["373.319","new anyway let's start reading uh "],["376","chapter one verse one so join me as we "],["379.639","read verse one the Oracle that habach "],["382.4","the prophet saw okay let's "],["385.28","stop I went a little uh extra crazy here "],["388.639","I went overbo I had five versions of the "],["391.24","Bible open as I was reading this um I "],["393.599","normally do three occasionally I do four "],["395.84","rarely I do I go for five because when I "],["398.24","then crack open my inner linear I now "],["400.319","have six and that makes me take a really "],["403.199","long time going through this and this "],["404.759","was a really really busy week for me and "],["407.44","I was like I shouldn't do this but I "],["409.36","felt I had to so I did and what jumped "],["412.24","here is this phrase the Oracle the "],["414.56","prophet saw that's what I had in my ESV "],["417.68","if you have the nasby it says the same "],["419.56","thing the csb reads the pronouncement "],["423.08","the prophet saw are nivans in the crowd "],["425.759","they have the prophecy that the prophet "],["428.24","received and our old school KJV and have "],["431.56","the burden which the prophet did see and "],["434.84","someone here say might have some other "],["436.36","version of the book so on a count of "],["437.96","three read it out loud one two "],["440.759","three yeah and then there's that one all "],["442.68","right so the main reason I'm stressing "],["445.879","this is that I don't want anyone getting "],["448.36","some weird beat movie kind of idea of "],["451.56","some old guy in a cloak leaning over a "],["453.8","crystal ball staring into an oracle or "],["456.24","they're like seek the lady in the cave "],["458.28","the Oracle speak that's not what we're "],["460","doing here that's not what the word is "],["462.96","okay it's not some object weird magic "],["465.96","type thing don't get that the Aramaic of "],["468.68","this word is completely different the "],["470.159","word typically is used to convey a "],["473.44","burden or a load like that which you "],["476.44","would load onto a beast of burden onto "],["479.4","your camel or onto your ass that then "],["482.199","they must they are pressed into carrying "],["485.52","do you understand that when it comes to "],["487.479","the "],["488.28","prophet and no I didn't just call him "],["491.36","that okay so the word means that so in "],["496.039","the books of the prophets this term is "],["498.12","used to convey then we take it a little "],["500.84","further to a Divine utterance sometimes "],["504.039","it's a mental Vision or a dream or a "],["506.72","mental sound it would take them meaning "],["509.68","of utterance so like God told me this or "],["513.719","God breathed this Oracle into me okay "],["518.519","and the word see the word saw not see "],["521.159","saw just see or saw is kind of like how "],["523.56","we sometimes use it today even in "],["526.12","English like I see your point because "],["528.64","you don't actually see "],["530.8","anything what you're saying is I "],["533.56","understand what you're saying I receive "],["536.48","as the NIV puts it your message that "],["538.839","you're "],["540.04","convey okay so we're not talking always "],["542.12","about a visual SE though sometimes we "],["543.959","can be okay is everyone with "],["546.44","me groovy let's continue with habach "],["549.399","complaint oh Lord how long shall I cry "],["553.079","for help and you will not hear or cry to "],["556.24","you violence and you will not save why "],["558.88","do you make me see iniquity and why do "],["561.64","you idly look at wrong destruction and

"],["138.599","take on uh some different roles I'm "],["141.36","What's called the church planning "],["142.56","director and my wife is called the "],["144.239","women's ministry director and what

"],["173.22","prayer that is answered for us so we've "],["175.379","been we're hoping for when we took on "],["177.239","the role it had always been done by In "],["180.18","This sort of an individual way "],["181.98","but our experience in Indonesia for 13 "],["184.56","years was always done in the context of "],["186.959","team and we felt like we were better "],["189.06","when we worked with others and so we "],["192.3","invited "],["193.319","Melody Bowers who were in Albania for 23 "],["196.44","years planting churches among Muslims to "],["199.5","come and join us and it's been a huge "],["201.42","asset a huge benefit to us so they serve "],["204.54","as the associate directors alongside us "],["206.519","and we've been now working together in "],["209.22","Malaga for a little over a year and "],["211.44","we're really thankful for Peter and "],["212.879","Melody so you can continue to pray for "],["214.68","us as we continue to find what it means "],["216.959","to lead together next slide "],["219.42","this gives you a little snapshot of who "],["221.28","we are as an organization where we are "],["222.959","the green sort of highlights the places "],["224.58","where we have teams a little bit broadly "],["227.7","and so we have a variety of teams "],["229.86","working around the country you'll see "],["232.56","the it's kind of a lot of it is pretty "],["234.599","much in that 1042 window but we do have "],["237.18","teams in other places like North America "],["238.98","Europe where Syrian refugees have moved "],["242.459","where Afghan people have moved in all "],["244.92","these different people groups that have "],["246.54","come to the West we also have teams "],["249","working with them in those places next "],["251.7","slide "],["253.62","um so we have right now 322 Church "],["256.32","Planters in our church planning division "],["259.139","working on with 41 different people "],["262.019","groups "],["263.46","um and so uh that kind of gives you an "],["266.16","idea we have about 80 I think it's 82 "],["268.68","teams it kind of changes every year a "],["270.419","little bit but that's where we're at "],["271.8","going to the next slide "],["274.08","all right and as we came into the role "],["277.1","of directing this division uh we were "],["280.8","praying and asking God to give us wisdom "],["282.6","how do we lead this well what does that "],["284.1","look like and we worked along with Peter "],["286.38","and Melody and this is the vision that "],["287.759","we have for our missionaries uh so "],["290.639","members is a non-missionary word for "],["293.4","missionaries so that we can send this "],["295.08","out to places where we don't want to use "],["296.94","the word missionary so healthy members "],["298.919","on healthy teams planning healthy "],["301.02","churches okay next slide so then we kind "],["303.479","of said well how how are we going to "],["305.22","help that to happen "],["306.479","and so we look at each of our "],["307.979","missionaries and we say there's two "],["309.479","parts of them that we really need to be "],["311.04","pouring into and caring for and the one "],["313.979","aspect is just like any follower of "],["315.54","Jesus right they are a child of God so "],["317.82","what does it look like for us to invest "],["319.979","in their personal relationship with "],["321.72","Jesus to help them to be growing in "],["324.3","their personal walk with Christ now you "],["325.74","got to remember they've gone to least "],["327.419","reached areas "],["328.8","so let's say they're in the Middle East "],["330.36","and they're there to plant a church "],["331.919","because no church exists well they don't "],["333.84","have a church to go to they don't have "],["335.639","the opportunity to come and have "],["336.84","Fellowship to grow with each other and "],["339.66","so "],["340.56","church planning division "],["342.6","are one of our responsibilities within "],["344.639","our leadership as we invest in our "],["346.02","leaders is to do some of that "],["347.699","shepherding and care so that's member "],["349.919","care that's spiritual care in the lives "],["352.08","of each of these people and we do that "],["354.3","through a variety of things uh some of "],["356.22","that comes directly through the "],["357.36","leadership process we also have "],["359.4","conferences that we put on for our "],["361.74","missionaries so for example in October "],["363.72","Pastor Rob and Ileana and a few others "],["366.9","are going to join us uh Ricky you'll be "],["369.24","there right leading to music they're "],["371.1","going to come and they're going to "],["371.94","they're going to help us as we bring "],["373.74","missionaries who have been on the field "],["374.82","for two to four years "],["376.259","we're going to bring in what we call our "],["377.58","Thrive conference and they're going to "],["379.56","get a chance to sing worship songs with "],["382.02","more than two or three people for the "],["383.52","first time potentially in two to four "],["385.199","years they're gonna have an opportunity "],["387","to hear from the word and to be fed for "],["389.58","the first time in two to four years and "],["391.62","so these are some of the ways that we "],["393.72","want to invest and say how do we help "],["395.16","them grow as a child of God then also we "],["397.8","have church Planters that's our whole "],["399.539","goal "],["401.28","um but Bible colleges in the west are "],["404.88","getting smaller and smaller "],["407.1","um there's it's okay it's actually not "],["408.9","the worst thing that's ever happened to "],["409.919","the church but it's just a reality that "],["411.539","we're facing and so as people come and "],["413.699","join our organization they're not "],["415.86","necessarily coming always with the same "],["417.539","background of training and so one of the "],["419.88","things that the international director "],["421.259","asked me to develop was what we call our "],["424.199","Polaris church planning training and "],["426.78","it's we've developed a pathway go ahead "],["428.58","and go to the next slide as well "],["430.5","that tries to help people to think this "],["432.9","through so I'm going to take you through "],["434.1","a Polaris mini okay are you ready to go "],["436.319","on this journey with me all right we do "],["438.24","this for a week but I'm going to give "],["439.979","you the the summary that I can give you "],["441.78","this morning to help you think about how "],["443.819","do we help missionaries wrestle with "],["445.319","this so this is an idyllic sort of "],["447.78","church that you may imagine "],["450.18","um in the countryside somewhere here in "],["452.16","Maryland and when we as much as we no "],["457.08","matter what culture we're coming from so "],["458.58","we have some of our missionaries "],["459.479","actually come from the Philippines and "],["461.34","join our teams okay they're going to "],["463.44","take a picture of their experience of "],["465","church in the Philippines and they're "],["466.62","going to bring that into the Middle East "],["468.9","or here we're in the U.S and we're going "],["470.699","to take our experience of Faith Bible "],["472.86","Church and we're going to go and we're "],["474.24","going to say I'm going to try I'm going "],["475.38","to want to reproduce this in the Middle "],["477.479","East well the problem is this is a "],["479.88","wonderful culturally relevant context "],["482.099","for Americans who live in Maryland "],["484.86","but as much as we know that that's not "],["486.96","what the church is going to look like in "],["488.16","the Middle East it's very hard to "],["489.72","actually deculturalize ourselves right "],["492.06","because go ahead and hit the next slide "],["493.8","what church actually ends up looking "],["496.08","like is often like this or one more or "],["498.96","like this "],["500.28","and so when we think about what church "],["502.56","is we really have to remove a lot of the "],["504.66","cultural aspects of what we think about "],["506.52","and that's true even in this County of "],["509.639","Maryland right if you want to start a "],["511.08","church out there "],["512.64","where people that maybe wouldn't come to "],["514.38","this building and you want to kind of "],["515.82","get things started out there until "],["517.2","they're able to come here you have to "],["519.06","change what we think the expression of "],["521.58","church looks like "],["523.44","um so it could be like this so go into "],["524.64","the next slide so we have uh three "],["528.36","essential things that we talk to our "],["529.74","church planners about their specific "],["531.36","role and then the next slide don't go "],["533.519","there yet we'll tell you the five uh "],["536.1","things that we look at as the basis of "],["537.66","saying this is what it means to plan a "],["540","church so for our church Planters the "],["541.8","role number one the church planner's "],["544.32","role is temporary "],["547.26","and what happens is sometimes people say "],["549.42","I'm going to go plan a church and what "],["550.74","they really mean is I'm going to go "],["551.76","Pastor a new church "],["553.56","and and there's a little Nuance there "],["555.779","and and when you can sort of send a "],["557.58","group of people and and you can plan a "],["559.68","church like in in the U.S that that can "],["561.779","work "],["562.86","and that Pastor is coming from this "],["564.54","culture and so it makes sense but when "],["566.76","you're working cross-culturally we want "],["568.98","our missionaries to think like Paul like "],["571.32","Titus like Timothy that their role is to "],["575.16","do something temporary and that the "],["577.56","church that they plant is what will last "],["579.839","and then they can go on to the next "],["581.399","thing and so trying to help to transform "],["583.08","that mindset "],["584.459","so that means that how we start things "],["587.22","is different "],["588.839","whenever possible we we try to bring in "],["592.14","a national believer to do anything that "],["594.6","that you that that they can do even if "],["596.399","it's not going to be as good as you can "],["598.14","do it "],["599.279","you're we're investing in that first "],["600.899","generation of leaders in that church so "],["602.58","the next thing "],["604.08","is the task so the the initial task of "],["606.36","the church planner is to empower new "],["607.92","Believers with the authority and the "],["609.66","responsibility so we want to trust the "],["611.94","spirit of God and the word of God to be "],["613.92","at work in the lives of new Believers to "],["617.16","the point that all that the leadership "],["619.5","and the church comes from there so the "],["621.42","third thing we have the role the task "],["623.459","one more "],["625.32","and then the priority the top priority "],["628.019","is to instill in every new believer the "],["630.06","understanding that God has given them "],["631.56","the spiritual gifts necessary for church "],["634.26","in that place "],["635.76","so if this outside missionary something "],["637.92","happens they lose their Visa or you know "],["640.74","there's a there's any situation that "],["642.839","pulls this person out it doesn't matter "],["645.959","because what is needed for church "],["648.3","already exists in that Community all "],["650.339","right go to the next "],["651.72","so outside of these we also talk about "],["653.459","these essential elements of church so go "],["655.74","ahead and click this off there's five "],["656.94","here that will show up "],["658.44","all right so if when we talk about "],["661.079","church planting and we say a church has "],["663.18","been planted within our organization "],["664.68","this is how we Define it all right that "],["667.2","means that there's there are believers "],["670.68","who gather or there's a nucleus of "],["672.66","believers who identify with Jesus and "],["674.22","baptism so they've come to Faith they've "],["676.56","been baptized that's one two they're "],["678.899","Gathering regularly "],["680.76","okay and again what it looks like can "],["683.519","vary it could be under a tree it could "],["685.62","be in a borrowed building it could be in "],["687.3","a house one of the churches that we "],["689.519","helped plants started in a reformed "],["691.62","pigsty no joke but they cleaned it all "],["694.8","out and that's where they started and it "],["696.6","was it was really fun to just show up "],["698.339","there and think yeah this is the church "],["700.62","all right so they're Gathering regularly "],["702.959","and the things that are happening when "],["704.22","they gather "],["705.2","is they there's worship teaching prayer "],["708.18","and fellowship so those elements are are "],["710.459","in place "],["711.779","third the leadership their spiritually "],["713.76","qualified you know we take that from "],["715.5","Titus for and Timothy passages and "],["718.32","they're selected from the local church "],["720.72","ordinances are being practiced that "],["722.339","means there's baptism in the communion "],["723.66","and the fifth one and not not every "],["726.24","organization or not every Church would "],["728.04","sort of add this to their definition but "],["729.66","we're saying that church is multiplying "],["731.76","itself in the community "],["733.38","so there are people who are members of "],["735.18","that church who are sharing their faith "],["736.86","and people are coming to Christ because "],["738.6","of them not because of the missionary "],["741.3","does that make sense so so if the "],["743.22","missionary is still the primary "],["744.66","evangelist that church hasn't planted "],["746.399","yet "],["747.24","but when the people who have come to "],["749.22","Faith are now sharing their faith and "],["752.1","people are coming to Faith because of "],["753.36","that then that that's for us kind of the "],["755.459","final step we say okay that's a planted "],["757.38","church now that doesn't mean it's a "],["759.48","mature Church it doesn't mean that there "],["760.86","isn't growth There's an opportunity for "],["763.32","it to become a a more mature adult "],["765.72","church but it's a baby church and it's "],["768.12","doing all the the healthy good things "],["769.8","that a baby does and sometimes babies "],["771.6","you know create a little bit of mess but "],["774.06","we don't get mad at them we we just kind "],["776.76","of say good job all right next time "],["778.26","let's try a little you know let's let's "],["779.639","get the spoon a little closer to the "],["780.959","mouth like we want most of the food in "],["783.06","right and so that's that's sort of the "],["785.399","process of first planning it's it's "],["786.6","messy and that's okay it's it's uh "],["789.959","whenever a church planner is kind of "],["792","feeling down "],["793.019","I just take him to first and second "],["794.519","Corinthians and I say hey none of this "],["797.459","is happening in your church plans so "],["799.68","you're doing great okay "],["801.48","um it was a mess for Paul too and that's "],["803.519","okay it isn't whether our churches are "],["805.62","perfect or not no church is perfect it's "],["807.48","are they moving closer to Jesus all "],["809.94","right and that's our goal is that people "],["811.44","are moving closer to Christ "],["813.3","um our um director of uh the mobization "],["816.6","center in the U.S he had a guy come up "],["819","to him and say hey what what what "],["820.139","defines success for missionaries "],["822.48","according to your organization and our "],["824.7","our mosulation director Steve Coffey he "],["826.8","said if if the missionary loves Jesus "],["828.66","more than when he went to the field when "],["831.48","he finishes then then it was a success "],["834","right and that that is true if our "],["836.16","missionaries love Jesus more when they "],["837.66","finish then that's a success and if "],["839.16","they've reproduced that in the lives of "],["840.72","the people that they're serving right "],["842.339","and that's that's I'm sure that's the "],["843.779","goal of faith that you would leave this "],["846.06","place loving Jesus more than when you "],["848.22","first came "],["849.12","and then and that's how you that's how "],["850.74","we define success in serving Christ okay "],["853.139","so these five things are in place all "],["854.76","right next slide "],["856.8","and so "],["858.12","um what what we've developed is what we "],["859.98","call our our our model or our pathway "],["862.32","for church planting and I just want to "],["863.639","walk you through it and what this has "],["865.68","done is provided a good context for "],["867.3","conversations both within the team but "],["869.7","also when a leader kind of comes for a "],["871.62","visit they can sit down at the team and "],["873.54","say hey where are we at in the church "],["874.8","planning process so you see the biggest "],["876.779","bubble there's prayer all right the "],["879","prayers around the whole thing what does "],["880.86","it look like to mobilize prayer for the "],["882.899","people groups we're trying to reach like "],["884.76","we have our prayer updates we send out "],["886.199","that's great can we mobilize prayer in a "],["889.199","bigger way can we get Advocates at the "],["891.24","churches that support us to really push "],["893.579","out for more prayer for our people group "],["895.199","and then as we move forward prepare "],["897.48","happens before the field so we have "],["899.16","what's called new Personnel orientation "],["901.38","for someone who joins the organization "],["903.12","and then we have pre-departure "],["904.92","orientation right six months before they "],["907.26","leave and there's a lot of different "],["909.18","things that are happening there to "],["910.74","prepare people for the field including "],["913.26","the training um called this Polaris "],["915.48","training that we do and then survey all "],["918.3","right survey what is the point of survey "],["920.459","it is finding out who are these people "],["922.8","that we're seeking to reach "],["924.42","what do they believe what are their "],["926.1","values "],["927.36","learning their language and going deep "],["929.639","into the culture because what you learn "],["932.04","from survey informs how you're going to "],["934.8","contact people that's the next the next "],["936.6","phase "],["937.5","and how you're going to proclaim the "],["939.18","good news "],["940.56","and if we don't do the hard work of "],["942.6","really learning the language if we don't "],["943.92","do the hard work of really understanding "],["945.66","the people and you guys get this those "],["946.98","of you who are doing evangelism in the "],["948.42","community "],["949.68","you've got to know what where did they "],["951.959","gather what do they believe why is that "],["954.3","important to them and to bring the "],["956.04","gospel in a way that connects with who "],["957.899","they are so the survey work takes about "],["960.899","a year and a half to learn that language "],["963.12","to understand the people at least "],["965.22","sometimes two years depending on the "],["966.72","difficulty of the language but you have "],["968.639","to that's an investment that has to be "],["970.26","made in order for good contact and "],["972.54","Proclamation and then you see "],["973.56","discipleship is the core of any good "],["975.839","church plant "],["977.639","if you don't have discipleship you're "],["979.26","not going to be able to plan a church "],["980.339","because that is that investment in the "],["983.1","lives of of the new Believers this is "],["985.8","how they're going to grow this is where "],["987.3","the the leaders are gonna are gonna rise "],["989.76","up out of this discipleship process and "],["992.22","so discipleship starts from the moment "],["993.899","we contact someone all right and this is "],["996.36","true for you here at Faith Bible if you "],["998.519","are you know at the gas station and "],["1000.5","you're talking to the the person who "],["1002.24","serves is you know providing service and "],["1004.04","you get to Jesus or you get to God "],["1007.82","that's the start of discipleship you've "],["1009.8","just started to point them to Jesus and "],["1011.24","now you've got to think all right next "],["1013.04","time I go "],["1014.24","how do I how do I help them to make like "],["1016.519","that next micro decision "],["1018.56","to like turn towards Jesus to think "],["1020.36","about what it means to know God and so "],["1023.12","from so we we really work with our "],["1025.16","people that from the point of contact "],["1027.26","you take them as far as they'll go "],["1029.48","we can't control them God is God is at "],["1031.52","work right the Holy Spirit has to be at "],["1033.02","work as well but we want to push them "],["1035","towards Christ every opportunity we have "],["1037.52","and take them as far as they're willing "],["1039.319","to go all right so "],["1040.88","contact proclaimed disciple and then we "],["1043.28","always we're trying to get together "],["1044.36","because we're a church planting "],["1045.74","organization "],["1047.12","so we want to get to that point where we "],["1049.1","have a a nucleus of people who are "],["1051.86","gathering together regularly and then "],["1054.98","it's all about equipping that that group "],["1057.08","of people "],["1058.16","what does our discipleship plan what's "],["1059.9","that look like so I can sit down with "],["1061.46","the team "],["1062.48","and I can say hey all right how are you "],["1064.64","guys doing all right looks like you've "],["1066.02","got a group of disciples you're starting "],["1068.059","to gather what's your plan for "],["1069.44","discipleship "],["1071","what have you guys put together what's "],["1072.559","that look like and and either they can "],["1074.36","Define that and we can we can work on it "],["1076.46","or they'll say oh you know what we've we "],["1078.799","need we need to really do some more work "],["1080.6","in that area and so for us as "],["1082.1","organization this helps us sort of give "],["1084.26","some some guide rails to all of our "],["1086.6","church planning teams to keep them "],["1088.039","moving in the right direction all right "],["1089.9","so go ahead and go to the next slide "],["1093.62","um by God's grace we're excited that in "],["1095.6","2022 through our network of teams we saw "],["1099.02","17 churches considered planted 208 "],["1102.02","baptisms and uh so we're just really "],["1104.24","excited to see that God is at work and "],["1106.64","remember this is among these are first "],["1108.679","generation "],["1110.24","Believers coming from Hindu Buddhists "],["1112.7","and Muslim backgrounds "],["1114.799","um every time someone comes to faith in "],["1117.5","these communities it is an absolute "],["1118.88","Miracle it is something God is doing in "],["1121.16","the hearts of people and this uh the red "],["1123.44","kind of shows you approximately where "],["1125.84","these places are where the churches were "],["1128.419","planted so go ahead and go to the next "],["1129.98","slide "],["1131.66","and I want to tell you some stories now "],["1133.28","just to give you an idea I've um go "],["1135.44","ahead into the next slide "],["1137.419","we we do a survey every year of all our "],["1139.46","teams we we get a little bit of a report "],["1141.38","and we always say hey tell us some "],["1142.76","stories "],["1144.02","wherever you're at whatever phase or "],["1146","stage you're in in the church plant and "],["1147.559","so I've selected some different ones "],["1149.24","from some of the different phases as "],["1152.48","they're going so this first one comes "],["1154.039","someone that's pretty new to the field "],["1156.32","they're in that early contact stage and "],["1159.38","this is what he says the Muslim friend "],["1161.36","from work to start a Bible study several "],["1163.28","times "],["1164.48","he finally agreed when we went hiking "],["1167.48","and engaged in an outdoor Bible study in "],["1169.52","the Book of John surprisingly he opened "],["1171.62","his Bible app on his own phone showed "],["1173.9","great interest and asked great questions "],["1175.82","and so this comes from one of our "],["1177.38","workers who is a Marketplace "],["1178.82","professional he has a job in the country "],["1181.16","of service that's how he's there "],["1183.26","and but but we for he's part of our "],["1185.78","organization because we give him the "],["1187.22","church planning training and the member "],["1188.78","care "],["1189.559","and he was uh he had been trying to get "],["1192.14","this guy to do a Bible study but what he "],["1193.94","found out later was "],["1195.559","the guy was too afraid of what other "],["1197.539","people would think or see but when they "],["1199.58","went on a hiking trip and it's just them "],["1201.62","out by themselves "],["1203.179","the guy opens up not only does he "],["1205.76","willing to engage the Bible he already "],["1207.559","had the Bible app on his phone "],["1209.96","and it was a great reminder to this "],["1211.52","missionary that God is already doing "],["1213.26","work in the lives of people that we "],["1215.419","don't always see "],["1216.62","and he was shocked that he actually had "],["1218.84","the Bible in Arabic on his phone already "],["1221.12","so that's just a really neat story of "],["1223.64","even that contact stage as we're "],["1225.559","faithful God is doing stuff that we "],["1227.96","can't see so next story "],["1230.96","um so it says praise the Lord for E "],["1232.82","change names and all that to keep people "],["1234.86","safe "],["1236.12","who found Us online came to join our "],["1238.34","group and was discipled and trained to "],["1239.96","lead during covet he led our online "],["1242.539","Ministry even though he had moved to the "],["1244.28","UK "],["1245.179","now he coordinates in Iranian Church's "],["1247.34","online Ministry so this guy "],["1249.559","was in a temporary so he's from Iran was "],["1252.679","in a different country where we have a "],["1254.12","team "],["1254.96","as as an sorry as a refugee and he was "],["1259.039","looking for a final placement he was "],["1261.02","applying for Canada U.S UK wherever they "],["1263.6","would get him "],["1264.74","during that time he came to faith and "],["1266.72","our team got about two and a half years "],["1268.64","with him to invest in him "],["1270.62","and now when he finally got his "],["1272.48","placement in the UK God's using him to "],["1275.12","lead he came to Faith through an online "],["1276.86","Ministry now he's leading an online "],["1279.14","Ministry from the UK reaching Iranians "],["1281.419","around the world so just a great story "],["1283.34","of how God can can multiply the effort "],["1285.679","of mission teams by even moving someone "],["1288.98","on and the investment they made okay "],["1291.38","next story "],["1294.5","um so this this is a team that says we "],["1297.02","got to experience Street evangelism in a "],["1299","new way this year when a man from our "],["1301.34","church our fellowship so this was the "],["1303.26","church that they had helped to plant "],["1305.419","helped to lead us in using worship music "],["1307.76","as a way to spark conversations and "],["1309.98","intrigue uh for people passing during a "],["1313.1","National Music Festival so they worked "],["1315.2","with an ethno musicologist who helped "],["1317.659","them develop Christian music that was "],["1320.9","like the music of the country where this "],["1323.059","is from does that make sense and so they "],["1325.7","were playing this music at the National "],["1327.08","Music Festival sounded like the regular "],["1329.6","music but the words obviously were "],["1331.159","talking about God "],["1332.539","and it just created and sparked these "],["1334.58","really interesting conversations "],["1337.22","um you know just this is just an "],["1339.26","illustration of how a church that's "],["1341.299","already been planted it's quite small "],["1342.559","still but how they can use their own "],["1344.659","creativity and their giftings to get out "],["1347.6","into the community for the for the to do "],["1350.299","evangelism you know all right so next "],["1352.4","next one "],["1355.22","um so this is a story about a short-term "],["1357.44","team and this is something that we can "],["1359.12","talk about in the future how many what "],["1360.74","kind of short-term trips could Faith do "],["1362.96","with us but Isabelle was a short-termer "],["1366.5","um she met a young lady named a "],["1369.26","um and they met over and over during the "],["1371.12","time that she was there in a month-long "],["1372.62","short-term trip "],["1374.96","um they were talking about Bible study "],["1376.94","and a asked if she could study as well "],["1379.22","so e who is our long-term missionary "],["1382.1","there "],["1383","and Isabel have followed up with her "],["1385.039","pray that regular Bible studies would "],["1387.32","occur and I'll give you an update on "],["1388.52","this one "],["1389.78","um "],["1390.44","this was in a South East Asia country "],["1394.7","where in the main city a lot of the "],["1397.22","young people speak English "],["1399.02","so they brought a bunch of U.S college "],["1400.52","students over and just said hey if you "],["1402.26","get kicked out of the country you're "],["1403.82","only here for a month anyways who cares "],["1405.44","so just be you know be wide open so they "],["1407.48","were very open with their faith and this "],["1409.94","started this whole conversation and "],["1411.5","there is an ongoing Bible study "],["1412.76","happening because of this so just a cool "],["1415.22","way that short terms can kind of come in "],["1417.26","and they can be a little more you know "],["1419.72","open because of the the temporariness of "],["1423.14","their stay and giving an opportunity for "],["1425.48","the long-term team to follow up all "],["1427.1","right another story "],["1431","all right so this is a different guy and "],["1433.1","this is in a country in North Africa "],["1435.799","and this guy named a he came to Faith he "],["1438.919","shared with hundreds of people "],["1440.78","he was just one of those people that you "],["1443.36","don't expect it to happen because "],["1445.34","they're in a country where there's "],["1447.2","serious persecution but when he came to "],["1449.48","Faith he didn't care "],["1451.94","um and he just went out and he was "],["1453.679","sharing his faith to the point that the "],["1455.24","missionaries were kind of like "],["1456.799","I don't know if this is going well "],["1459.74","um I I talked with the with one of the "],["1461.299","missionaries there but they just said "],["1462.98","all right this is what God is doing in "],["1465.38","him he shared with hundreds of people "],["1467.9","um so now he and five other people have "],["1471.2","started "],["1472.28","um uh have come to Faith in the past "],["1474.559","year and they started to gather as a "],["1476.179","group of Believers so not yet a church "],["1478.28","but there's something that God is doing "],["1480.94","that that that is pretty neat in that "],["1483.919","very very closed Muslim uh country all "],["1488","right next "],["1490.52","um and this is the last I think of the "],["1491.84","story so "],["1493.64","um this is a group of immigrants who are "],["1497.36","Dowry speakers so that's primarily "],["1499.1","Afghan "],["1500.6","um people though there are a few other "],["1502.7","um people groups that speak Dari and and "],["1504.62","they're all part of this Dari speaking "],["1506.98","community so a large group of these "],["1509.659","diary speakers came have come to Faith "],["1511.52","in about it's been about a year and a "],["1512.96","half two years that this has been going "],["1514.46","on "],["1516.08","um and they are gathering for regular "],["1517.64","Bible study and this worker says we "],["1520.34","believe that this group will be "],["1521.659","established as a church at some point "],["1523.88","this year so we expect sometime in the "],["1526.4","fall to hear another church has been "],["1528.32","planted "],["1529.4","um so just just little snapshots from "],["1531.98","different aspects of our workers and "],["1534.02","what God is doing "],["1536.48","and before I spend some time in QA q a I "],["1539.84","just want to share from Ephesians 4 with "],["1542.72","you really quick give you one quick "],["1544.46","challenge something to think about "],["1546.5","and it's a verse I think maybe we don't "],["1548.419","always think about when it comes to the "],["1550.4","gospel "],["1551.24","but I hope that uh as I share with you "],["1553.88","we talk about it it will make sense it's "],["1556.22","Ephesians 4 26. all right so here's what "],["1559.22","Ephesians 4 26 says "],["1565.46","um b-a sorry "],["1567.26","I got the wrong verse where I'm at "],["1568.94","Ephesians 4 28 sorry let the thief no "],["1572.36","longer steal but rather let him labor "],["1574.88","doing honest work with his own hands so "],["1577.34","that he may have something to share with "],["1579.26","anyone in need all right that's the "],["1580.94","verse so what's that have to do with "],["1582.62","missions and what's it have to do with "],["1583.82","the gospel "],["1585.08","well I love this verse because I feel "],["1587.24","like "],["1588.08","it is a in one verse it it really "],["1591.799","expresses the essence of what it really "],["1594.08","means for someone to come to Faith "],["1596.24","what it really means for the gospel to "],["1598.34","actually change the life of a person in "],["1600.86","this passage in Ephesians if you look up "],["1603.14","ahead at like verse 17 you'll probably "],["1605","have a little subtitle it says something "],["1606.5","like new life "],["1608","okay and uh what what this passage is "],["1611.24","really talking about is our new life in "],["1613.22","Christ and Paul gives different examples "],["1615.559","he talks about putting away falsehood "],["1617.539","speak the truth with your neighbor and "],["1618.86","all this kind of stuff but in verse 28 "],["1621.14","he addresses this idea of the thief "],["1624.62","and what I really like about this verse "],["1626.539","as we think about the gospel "],["1629","is I think especially in America "],["1632.539","and this is something I think the "],["1633.74","benefit of living in Asia for 13 years "],["1635.539","kind of helped me to get a different "],["1636.98","perspective on life in Asia it's all "],["1639.74","about the community right we don't you "],["1641.12","don't think about yourself as an "],["1642.2","individual you primarily think of who am "],["1644.24","I in the community I think in the states "],["1646.46","we we tend to think that that I come to "],["1649.159","Faith primarily so that I can go to "],["1651.799","heaven or Jesus saves me primarily so "],["1656.48","that I can have a better life not "],["1659.6","necessarily financially but just a "],["1660.98","better life like a right life or I come "],["1663.86","to Faith and it's primarily and we can "],["1666.02","fill in the blank of the reasons it was "],["1668.48","good for us "],["1670.279","and what I would like to challenge this "],["1671.779","with from this verse and and get us to "],["1674.12","think about "],["1675.2","is that "],["1676.94","the the primary purpose of why Christ "],["1679.58","saved you wasn't for you "],["1683.659","he loves you no doubt about it there's a "],["1686","lot of things about you that are true "],["1687.58","but if you look at this verse and you "],["1690.32","see what what he says Hey to a thief who "],["1692.779","comes to Faith here's what it should "],["1694.34","look like so let's go back to it "],["1696.44","verse 28 let the thief no longer steal "],["1699.14","but rather let him labor doing honest "],["1700.64","work with his own hands so that he can "],["1703.279","have something to share with anyone in "],["1705.5","need the Reason God transformed the life "],["1708.26","of the thief "],["1710.24","was so that he would be able to with the "],["1713.539","honest work of his hands have something "],["1714.74","to share with people in need "],["1717.679","and I think we all have a little bit of "],["1719.299","thief in us okay maybe we never stole "],["1722.12","anything from anybody "],["1724.159","but I think we all get it right we all "],["1726.679","have things that were true about us in "],["1729.2","our life that Dishonored God "],["1732.2","and we all struggle with those two this "],["1734","day "],["1735.32","and and God is doing a work in US but "],["1738.559","but what he really wants is through the "],["1741.32","Overflow of the work he's doing in US is "],["1744.02","that we would make him known "],["1747.38","through the way we live "],["1749.48","right so the thief what is he supposed "],["1751.34","to do work hard "],["1753.2","earn an income but not even primarily "],["1755.539","that he would have whatever he was "],["1757.34","trying to steal "],["1758.539","no no that he would primarily be able to "],["1761.179","bless other people "],["1762.86","and so what what he used to be which was "],["1765.08","someone who took now he's someone who "],["1767.419","gives "],["1768.86","and this is the gospel "],["1771.98","this is the gospel and if we look at "],["1773.72","like the you look at the um "],["1776.419","fruits of the spirit "],["1778.1","or the putting off and putting on "],["1779.659","passage like in Colossians all the stuff "],["1781.82","he put off "],["1782.84","is all me focused put off anger that's "],["1786.32","that's me trying to get what I want you "],["1788.24","know put off slander put off put off put "],["1790.34","off everything if you look in that "],["1791.539","passage in Colossians 3 it's all things "],["1794.059","that are focused on me getting what I "],["1795.98","want and then he says put on "],["1798.2","and and Colossians and Galatians 5 are "],["1800.12","very similar fruit of the spirit type "],["1801.74","stuff "],["1802.64","kindness who's that for "],["1804.919","that's for everyone in your life "],["1807.62","put on kindness patience gentleness "],["1809.899","goodness "],["1811.64","and so we find out that what what God "],["1814.46","primarily wants to do in our life "],["1816.08","through the gospel "],["1818.96","is to work through us "],["1821.059","and this is the incredible thing this is "],["1822.679","the thing that that almost doesn't make "],["1824.659","any sense is that God's primary plan for "],["1828.14","reaching the lost world "],["1830.899","Is Us "],["1833.36","it's crazy "],["1835.039","it it doesn't feel like it's it's right "],["1837.74","because we I think we each know our own "],["1839.899","Hearts I know mine "],["1842.299","and I'm like man Jesus could just have "],["1845.24","done it on his own "],["1847.159","but he that wasn't his plan "],["1849.2","and so for whatever reason God has the "],["1851.779","way that he is most glorified "],["1854","is when "],["1855.26","our life is transformed so that he is "],["1858.08","made known through us "],["1861.32","and so I just want to challenge you this "],["1863.419","is this is kind of what we're seeking to "],["1866.12","see happen in the lives "],["1868.46","of all of these missionaries "],["1872.12","missionaries are not different than you "],["1875","okay "],["1876.32","missionaries have had broken past "],["1880.039","a lot of them come from a family "],["1881.659","background that wasn't good "],["1884.179","missionaries have sometimes been "],["1886.159","molested or treated even sexually wrong "],["1889.039","in their past and they're getting over "],["1890.899","that "],["1894.08","but but what God is doing in US "],["1897.38","just like the thief "],["1900.08","is this beautiful beautiful thing and "],["1903.38","that's why I want to look at just a "],["1904.82","couple of passages when God does this "],["1906.86","thing in US here's a few things that he "],["1908.539","says are true about us as a church and "],["1911.659","as Believers so Matthew 5 "],["1914.659","real quick Matthew 5 13-16 look at this "],["1921.32","all right Matthew chapter 5. let's just "],["1923.779","start in verse 14. "],["1925.82","you are the light of the world "],["1929.539","you're a city on a hill that cannot be "],["1931.279","hidden "],["1937.159","that is unbelievable who is the actual "],["1939.44","light of the world "],["1942.2","Jesus is "],["1944.12","but Jesus says In this passage "],["1947.36","to us "],["1949.039","something that I don't think we deserve "],["1950.48","he says no you're the light of the world "],["1953.24","unbelievable "],["1955.279","has God done that work in you "],["1958.94","are you able to stand in that and say "],["1960.799","whoa I'm the light of the world "],["1963.5","Jesus has invited me "],["1965.899","and and God has made me a co-heir with "],["1968.419","Christ like I am a Son of God I'm a "],["1970.82","Child of God well I I am the light of "],["1972.919","the world "],["1974.419","what does that mean though what is the "],["1976.76","responsibility what what can you do how "],["1978.98","do you shine like that well when when "],["1981.86","God has done that transformational work "],["1983.72","like he did in the life of the thief now "],["1985.88","the thief shares "],["1987.799","so whatever your challenge has been "],["1990.2","whatever God has been working on in you "],["1995.419","'ll think "],["1996.5","and now you're Jesus now you're the "],["1998.299","light of the world in that sense you are "],["2000.82","like Christ in that way all right let's "],["2003.1","look again Jesus still talking John "],["2004.72","chapter 13. "],["2009.58","it's this undeserved Mercy that we were "],["2011.32","singing about "],["2012.64","that we get to live out "],["2015.039","so John "],["2017.14","chapter 13 verses 34 and 35. "],["2029.86","all right Jesus again saying a new "],["2032.08","commandment I give to you "],["2034.539","that you are to love one another just as "],["2036.34","I have loved you you also are to love "],["2038.14","one another by this all people will know "],["2040.059","that you are my disciples if you have "],["2041.86","love for one another "],["2043.24","so the old Command right the old command "],["2045.159","was love the Lord your God with all your "],["2047.26","heart soul mind and strength and love "],["2048.639","your neighbor as yourself that was the "],["2049.96","old very good command but Jesus says no "],["2052.78","no it's it's it gets a little bit better "],["2054.339","the new command is to love people the "],["2056.74","way I loved you "],["2058.24","and when you do that when Faith Bible "],["2060.28","Church loves in that way the community "],["2064.179","sees Jesus "],["2066.94","so what does it look like to be Faith "],["2068.379","Bible Church in the community and I've "],["2070.06","heard already a couple of examples "],["2073.06","of what the church is doing I just want "],["2074.74","to say like keep going "],["2078.04","this is great like this is great this is "],["2079.839","Faith Bible Church together in this "],["2082.119","building but what does it look like when "],["2084.04","Faith Bible Church is out there "],["2086.619","and what does it look like to be the "],["2088.3","light of the world where Jesus has "],["2091.06","placed you because Jesus says that "],["2093.399","that's that's who you are and that's "],["2095.5","what he wants you to do just shine in "],["2097.24","that way "],["2098.5","um "],["2100.66","we'll look at one more Philippians "],["2102.52","chapter 2. "],["2115","all right we're in Philippians 2 we're "],["2116.74","just going to look at verse 14 and "],["2118.3","through the beginning of 16.

want to encourage "],["2224.98","you pray for our missionaries they're "],["2227.619","seeking to be that kind of a light "],["2229.48","that's hard "],["2231.22","there's a lot of reasons it's hard "],["2232.66","they're separated from their families "],["2234.28","they're separated from the body of "],["2236.619","Christ there's a lot of reasons it's "],["2238.18","hard we're going to pour into them so "],["2240.16","that they can continue to be a light "],["2241.3","there and I look forward to keep hearing "],["2243.339","stories from here about how you do that "],["2246.04","same thing here for God's honor and His "],["2248.98","glory "],["2250.48","all right let's pray and then we're "],["2251.8","gonna do a q a Time "],["2254.14","God we thank you that you have entrusted "],["2256.96","us to be the light of the world we do "],["2258.46","not deserve it we have not earned it "],["2260.98","it's your mercy and it's your grace I "],["2263.32","pray that we would take up that "],["2266.859","responsibility that offer "],["2269.38","that privilege that you give to us and "],["2271.48","that as Carrie and I support our workers "],["2273.46","around the world that you give us Grace "],["2274.599","to do that well and I pray for for the "],["2277.24","Believers here in this body "],["2279.82","um that they would continue to see the "],["2281.68","people around them come to know Jesus "],["2283.72","and that they would shine like lights in "],["2285.88","a crooked generation in Jesus name we "],["2288.339","pray amen "],["2289.72","all right we're gonna do q a and so "],["2292.119","anything that you want to ask about "],["2294.04","missions you can ask something specific "],["2296.02","about what I talked about I'll do my "],["2298.3","best to give you an answer "],["2310.2","out of the uh Hindu Muslim and Buddhists "],["2313.42","what are the hardest people group to "],["2315.52","share the gospel with and why "],["2319.92","okay I'm going to make up an answer now "],["2322.78","um "],["2325","I'll say I guess the the Buddhist just "],["2327.4","be the hardest "],["2329.2","or just across the board that that is uh "],["2332.92","such a difficult world view to bring the "],["2337.18","gospel into because they believe in "],["2339.099","annihilation "],["2340.599","they don't even believe in an eternity "],["2342.22","necessarily and so you really like just "],["2344.14","to find Bridges or things that connect "],["2346.54","is very very difficult "],["2348.94","um in Hinduism it's easy to share about "],["2351.22","Jesus "],["2352.359","to a point because they're willing to "],["2354.339","kind of they're open to like other ideas "],["2355.96","but then you kind of get to this close "],["2358.54","point of he's the only one and with "],["2361.3","Muslims is very hard up front "],["2363.82","um because they're very very like close "],["2366.7","from the beginning so that would be the "],["2368.2","Nuance but I think if I was if I'm "],["2370.78","answering I'd say Buddhist is probably "],["2372.16","the most difficult "],["2379","other questions "],["2388.119","yeah "],["2389.7","like somebody wanted to know why we're "],["2391.54","in Malaga "],["2393.16","feeling oh lots of spiritual warfare and "],["2396.4","how you dealing with all that "],["2398.74","there yeah I mean there's certainly "],["2400.599","there is a lot of spiritual warfare "],["2403.359","um "],["2405.82","what I would I guess the way I try to "],["2407.44","answer this I would say I don't think "],["2408.579","there's more spiritual warfare "],["2410.74","necessarily "],["2413.44","it's more like what it looks like so I "],["2415.78","would say that spiritual warfare in "],["2418.24","America looks like the mall with all the "],["2420.94","stuff in it "],["2421.96","okay and I think Satan uses that to just "],["2424.599","basically mute us "],["2426.64","like we just we just love our stuff okay "],["2429.339","and so we we get focus on our stuff and "],["2431.619","we don't focus on helping other people "],["2433.839","know God but I think in places where "],["2437.2","um "],["2438.28","where we're facing uh trying to see "],["2440.74","people come to Faith In Like These more "],["2442.54","animistic communities then Satan already "],["2445.3","has people's hearts through that type of "],["2447.76","show of power and so we do see that show "],["2450.579","up there but I think the spiritual "],["2453.359","warfare that our missionaries face is "],["2456.22","the exact same spiritual warfare you "],["2458.2","face "],["2459.339","and I would encourage you to look at the "],["2461.859","world that way "],["2463.06","and to say wow like we we need the same "],["2466.72","kind of working of the spirit of God in "],["2469","our life as our missionaries do on the "],["2470.68","front lines "],["2471.7","um so that's how I would answer I don't "],["2472.96","think it's necessarily different I think "],["2474.76","the way it shows up "],["2476.619","and the way it's expressed "],["2478.72","can be different "],["2488.8","you mentioned one of your "],["2491.38","um in the slideshow there's someone who "],["2494.32","was doing like an online show or a "],["2496.96","church service or yeah some kind of "],["2498.52","mentoring so is there what kind of "],["2500.2","opportunities are there now with "],["2501.28","technology and even like post covid "],["2503.74","right for even missions that you're "],["2506.38","utilizing to to reach people "],["2509.02","so covid obviously was a factor of that "],["2512.26","but even before covid a lot of our teams "],["2516.04","have started to take what we call like a "],["2517.72","media to Faith or immediate movements "],["2521.38","um as a part of their overall approach "],["2523.18","to bringing the gospels just sometimes "],["2524.8","it's Facebook could be Instagram "],["2526.359","different things where they're putting "],["2528.28","things out that allow a response "],["2530.74","and uh there's a there's a group out "],["2532.839","there called kingdom.net that takes "],["2534.46","teams through uh what how to do that "],["2537.28","well and then how to like filter like "],["2539.32","you you when someone says I'm interested "],["2541.3","they could be hostile right they could "],["2543.28","be trying to figure out who's doing this "],["2544.66","so there's there's a a means by which "],["2547.18","you you work people through a series of "],["2549.099","questions and then eventually they get "],["2551.14","to the point and say I want to meet "],["2552.04","someone in person and then we can do "],["2554.14","that there's also "],["2556.18","um some media organizations out there "],["2558.579","that are Christian Media particularly "],["2560.5","doing that and our teams partner with "],["2562.3","them so our teams become the on the "],["2565.54","ground people that once it kind of goes "],["2567.7","through that filter our team could get a "],["2569.74","call and say hey this person is in your "],["2571.24","region would you meet them and so that "],["2573.46","it there are also some online things "],["2575.98","happening "],["2577.3","um "],["2578.2","but even with so even where there is "],["2580.42","these online Gatherings we do try "],["2583.3","eventually most media they do try to "],["2586.599","eventually get to something that's like "],["2588.22","face to face "],["2590.26","um because there is sort of a limit at "],["2592.78","some point to the ability to like to "],["2595.839","disciple someone when you're not in "],["2597.099","their life you know now it doesn't mean "],["2599.079","that they do the best they can but at "],["2600.7","some point somebody could be saying one "],["2602.5","thing and doing another thing unless you "],["2604","really are with them "],["2605.92","um so we I hope that answers your "],["2607.72","question yeah "],["2609.52","it uh I was struck by how many people "],["2611.5","were awaiting placement and it sounded "],["2613.359","like there's a lot of people that takes "],["2615.46","a while for people to get placed can you "],["2617.319","expand on how what's going on during "],["2619.48","that time and yeah so what happens is "],["2622.24","our mobilizers will meet someone and "],["2624.16","they say I'm interested in missions and "],["2625.839","so a conversation starts and then "],["2628.359","usually depending on you know where "],["2630.099","they're at a couple of months pass and "],["2632.38","they say okay I'd like to join the "],["2633.819","organization they go to a new Personnel "],["2635.5","orientation "],["2637.42","but then they have to raise their "],["2638.68","support and to do all that at average it "],["2640.9","takes about two years usually for people "],["2642.4","to go from New Personnel orientation "],["2644.619","to pre-departure orientation where they "],["2646.78","have the six months until they go to the "],["2647.98","field "],["2648.88","then they get to the field and it's at "],["2651.339","least two years of basically language "],["2653.74","study "],["2655","and cultural adaptation "],["2657.64","and then at about year three or four you "],["2661.359","both are fluent enough in the language "],["2662.859","and the understanding the culture that "],["2665.319","you can it doesn't mean that everything "],["2667.18","you've done after that is void "],["2669.579","but this is the thing about admissions "],["2671.92","it's a real investment because it's "],["2673.24","usually year three four or five before "],["2676.42","you're able to actually do what you want "],["2678.579","to do "],["2679.96","and so we really that's why we bring our "],["2681.76","missionaries together for the Thrive "],["2683.2","conference years two to four to say hey "],["2686.38","hang in there like all that stuff you "],["2688.66","wanted to do it's right around the "],["2689.98","corner you can do this you've got this "],["2692.38","you know we love you we care about you "],["2694.119","you're doing good because it can get "],["2697.18","disappointing right into that right in "],["2698.859","that period of missions life of like man "],["2701.859","are we ever going to get there so good "],["2703.96","great question yeah "],["2706.9","yeah "],["2708.339","so you hear a lot of uh people over "],["2711.52","there in the Middle East or around the "],["2713.38","world coming to know Christ through "],["2715.5","dreams and Visions have you guys "],["2717.76","experienced any of that with the "],["2719.44","Believers in the field yeah I mean we "],["2721.24","have regular stories of of "],["2723.819","people either finding our workers or "],["2727.3","you know as the gospel is shared what "],["2730","what we find is that typically if "],["2732.099","someone comes to Faith God has already "],["2734.2","done something "],["2735.76","whether it's a whether it's some "],["2737.8","interaction with "],["2739.44","the word of God sometimes it's they've "],["2742.66","seen the Jesus film randomly that was "],["2744.46","being piped in from somewhere or they've "],["2747.16","had some kind of a dream or an "],["2748.599","interaction so typically something else "],["2750.88","has happened "],["2752.079","that has cracked open the the door of "],["2755.38","their heart so that when our workers "],["2757.18","actually sit with them they kind of get "],["2759.099","the back story of what has God been "],["2761.079","doing "],["2762.4","um and that's one of I was saying like "],["2764.26","um I think when we went to the field of "],["2766","missionary Centric like I'm going to "],["2767.56","reach these people but each time someone "],["2769.359","come to Faith we'd find out all the "],["2770.92","stuff that God had already been doing in "],["2772.42","their life and it's like okay God is "],["2774.94","going to reach these people and I get to "],["2776.8","have a part in it you know and and the "],["2778.42","more as missionaries we "],["2780.28","like settle into that as our our "],["2783.339","responsibility role the more I think "],["2784.839","that we're able to be effective "],["2790.54","all right yep right there "],["2797.5","in what age um with the church plants or "],["2800.319","is it mostly the younger generation that "],["2802.54","are being converted or is it across all "],["2805.48","um Generations "],["2806.98","that I mean uh "],["2809.38","I would say for one is cross generations "],["2811.359","and yet that question would just are "],["2814.72","depending on the country it could be so "],["2816.76","so different "],["2818.8","um "],["2820.9","in some of the very "],["2822.94","harder line Muslim countries it is the "],["2825.22","younger generation in cities "],["2827.38","where there's they've kind of seen that "],["2829.54","there's something else out there and "],["2831.099","there's a little bit of openness "],["2833.079","but in a but in a lot of places yeah I "],["2835.9","think it's it's just the grace of God "],["2837.52","and so it just covers the Spectrum "],["2840.819","um like it's surprising sometimes like "],["2843.4","it's the grandfather you know who's the "],["2845.319","first to come to Faith and then he and "],["2846.88","God works through that into the rest of "],["2848.38","the family or so I don't I don't know "],["2850.48","that I would say there's a a specific "],["2852.22","trend of an age group "],["2854.44","that that is really identifiable "],["2857.859","so "],["2858.88","all right "]]},{"id":"ELhIjBXxdjQ","name":"2023-06-11  Missionary Guest Speaker, Dr. Mitch Arbeláez","date":"2023-06-11","transcript":[["2.52","foreign "],["21.02","well it's good to be

motivates you that's "],["70.74","my sermon title for today motivation is "],["74.159","defined as the stimulus or influence the "],["78","incentive or drive that moves someone to "],["83.04","accomplish a certain task "],["85.08","so my question is what motivates you now "],["90.18","I asked the children this question today "],["92.04","as as like you know Hobbies they do and "],["95.159","I said now if your parents don't have "],["97.02","you do anything at all what would you do "],["100.02","and of course some of the kids were you "],["101.759","know I'll watch video play video games "],["103.439","soccer you know and one precious little "],["106.079","girl I'm not going to say who because "],["107.46","their parents are probably going to beam "],["108.72","they say I'd read the Bible "],["111.18","you know that's what you want your "],["112.56","daughter to say you know I'd read the "],["114.18","Bible then I said so we don't have to "],["116.52","pay you money to do that they're like no "],["118.92","that's so the kids are understanding "],["120.96","this in the kids church today I want you "],["123.18","to think what would you do if you didn't "],["125.759","have to do anything in a sense what "],["128.459","motivates you to do what you do well I'm "],["130.619","going to share stories today "],["131.599","illustrations and we're going to answer "],["133.5","this question today so let me share a "],["135.78","true story with you uh my four kids when "],["138.12","they were young had a little dog named "],["139.8","Ginger it's the same dog just ones with "],["142.319","a haircut so "],["144.48","now like any little dog or family dog "],["146.94","Ginger would execute her business "],["149","outside in the backyard leaving her "],["152.16","packages on the lawn the expected "],["155.58","consequence of having such a family pet "],["157.879","requires a follow-up procedure this "],["161.519","follow-up procedure one must search out "],["164.16","the packages left by said family pet and "],["167.28","making sure to avoid any personal "],["168.78","unwanted contact with said packages and "],["172.26","perform the necessary lift and removal "],["175.26","to obtaining the packages in question "],["177.42","now needless to say this is the least "],["180.72","desirable job in the family and requires "],["184.08","much motivation to get any of the kids "],["187.019","to engage in this occupation of package "],["189.66","removal AKA poop scooping "],["194.04","now at this point you're like why did I "],["195.72","come to church and I'm listening to poop "],["197.099","scooping story "],["198.72","hey with me hang with me okay pastor Rob "],["201.06","is still here and I'm still here from "],["202.319","first service so just hang with me now "],["204.36","what if I was to tell you that I had all "],["207.18","of my four children engage in this very "],["210","Enterprise on Christmas morning "],["213.72","better yet let me share a picture of the "],["216.599","follow-up procedure in progress "],["219","now "],["220.26","there you see John Kyle and the orange "],["222.54","he's the only son and I have three girls "],["225.06","behind him he is what we call the expert "],["227.34","poop scooper now he is the one lifting "],["230.459","the actual package now next to him on "],["232.62","his left uh in the furry coat is Brianna "],["235.799","the oldest of the three girls we call "],["237.48","her Alpha sister and she is in the duty "],["240.54","of holding the uh the bag now holding "],["243.84","the bag procedure is a very important "],["245.58","because you haven't graduated to the uh "],["247.62","poop scooping yet but you're in a very "],["249.599","important position of bag holding then "],["252.299","the next one in the peak is Jaden she's "],["254.4","now 19 years old she is what we call "],["256.799","poop scooping and training she's "],["258.78","watching observing and learning the last "],["262.019","one our fourth child here is Alyssa Lynn "],["264.96","she is now 17 helped me to drive up to "],["267.66","DC the other day and

well now if look at this if you say "],["278.759","well before you make judgments on this "],["281.28","father that my kids are out there on "],["283.86","Christmas morning doing this let me "],["285.9","explain a little more all four of my "],["288.78","kids agreed to do this on their own "],["291.3","there was no threats no punishment and "],["294.419","no requirements prior to entering into "],["297.12","this Christmas into the Christmas "],["299.1","festivities matter of fact this "],["301.38","Enterprise took place after the family "],["304.02","traditional breakfast after all the "],["306.12","presents had been unwrapped and all the "],["308.1","gifts were given so how did this affair "],["310.74","come to be why would my four kids "],["313.86","volunteer to do this on Christmas "],["316.08","morning well because my kids had "],["319.44","motivation what was that motivation well "],["322.62","their grandmother had just bought them a "],["324.6","brand new trampoline and I said we "],["326.94","cannot put the trampoline up until the "],["328.74","yard is cleaned that Christmas morning "],["331.199","they had enough motivation to get out "],["333.18","there now if you look on their faces you "],["334.979","can tell that they probably didn't "],["336.419","suffer very much at all there was no "],["338.88","harm that came to them and having to "],["340.86","suffer by doing such a dirty deed prior "],["343.86","to the Joy they experienced now let me "],["346.38","zoom in a little bit here and look at "],["348.18","this picture that's the three girls "],["349.62","there "],["350.699","and you can see the smallest one Alyssa "],["352.62","what kind of family did I birthed into "],["355.1","but she is right along with the other "],["357.419","ones absolutely overwhelmed with joy "],["361.56","because of what they are getting to "],["363.66","experience so for my kids the joy that "],["366.72","was set before them of their

"],["1237.74","interesting show I began to watch this "],["1239.72","grown men out there playing with rockets "],["1241.82","they even launched an outhouse in the "],["1243.86","air just to see how

to planes "],["1270.32","diverted around there so that this "],["1272.12","person these teams could launch this "],["1274.039","rocket into the air you know the "],["1275.72","suspense was built up

"],["1280.58","Esau or not so Jacob went near to Esau "],["1283.76","his father and he felt him and said the "],["1285.559","voice is Jacob's voice but the hands are "],["1287.419","the hands of Esau "],["1290.72","and he did not recognize him because his "],["1292.7","hands were hairy like his brother Isa so "],["1294.86","he blessed him then he said are you "],["1296.539","really my son Isa and he said I am "],["1299.6","here's inherited religion with lie "],["1302.539","number one I am Esau the firstborn "],["1305.48","how is it that you have found itself lie "],["1307.58","number two

"],["215.4","about how we handle our finances what we "],["219.06","do with our money "],["220.799","because it all belongs to him we don't "],["222.84","own it "],["224.099","but instead we're

"],["422.039","that there will not be room enough to "],["425.1","receive it "],["427.44","you know and notice that God's not just "],["429.479","saying I'm going to bless you it's going

the things "],["510.9","that destroy the fruit of the ground "],["514.86","uh Matthew 6 33 which should be familiar "],["518.039","to many of us seek first the kingdom of "],["520.32","God and his

and so this is true of "],["546.779","individuals and true of of us as a "],["549.66","church as well "],["551.1","I think back when we were expanding or "],["553.44","thinking about expanding our facilities "],["555.3","here this is this is the expansion "],["558.72","uh we as Leaders didn't want to divert "],["561.3","our attention from ministering to the "],["564.54","needs of folks in in the in the "],["567.42","congregation uh we didn't want to start "],["569.94","some kind of fundraising campaign or you "],["573","know put a thermometer up here that "],["574.86","would just track everybody's giving and "],["576.839","pledges and all that you know we felt "],["579.899","God just like uh in the book of Acts you "],["583.26","know the apostles delegated "],["585.48","the daily distribution of food to the "],["588.6","the newly appointed deacons you know "],["591.3","there was ladies there up in years that "],["594.18","needed care they didn't have social "],["595.98","security their families were not around "],["598.44","or uh maybe had been someplace else and "],["602.94","so the the apostles back then did the "],["605.88","same thing that we did here you know "],["607.74","they delegated and brother Dick Neville "],["610.14","took that on and made that uh made this "],["614.22","whole construction Expansion Project "],["617.12","something that he would take on and uh "],["620.7","and lead us in but we weren't going to "],["622.74","concern ourselves overly with that "],["627.66","that project "],["630.6","and then in Acts it says as a result uh "],["634.56","because the apostles you know did that "],["637.2","delegation they devoted themselves "],["639.42","continually to prayer and to the "],["641.64","ministry of the word "],["643.86","the word of God spread "],["647.04","the number of disciples multiplied "],["648.959","greatly in Jerusalem "],["651.54","and the great many of the priests were "],["653.519","obedient to the faith "],["656.04","so God's word spread there was there was "],["658.62","an impact in the community because of "],["660.839","what happened inside "],["662.6","the body of Believers at the time "],["667.019","excuse me "],["669.06","and then in in Malachi God moves from "],["672","something uh that we were just talking "],["675.48","about money to something even more "],["677.64","precious "],["679.32","time "],["681","you know okay it's all well and good to "],["683.339","write a check give money to a cause you "],["686.04","put some money in the plate once a while "],["687.66","good you know praise God for that but "],["690","giving time that's that's part of your "],["691.86","life you know that that's something "],["693.66","that's even more dear "],["696.42","and so very similar to our situation "],["698.88","today "],["699.92","you find in verse 13 your words have "],["703.14","been harsh against me says the Lord "],["707","harsh words and yet you say what have we "],["711.06","spoken against you "],["713.94","you have said it's useless "],["716.279","to serve God "],["719.22","what prophet is it that we have kept his "],["721.68","ordinance "],["722.76","that we have walked as mourners before "],["725.7","the Lord of hosts "],["728.339","so interestingly enough here you know "],["730.74","God listens in on our conversations this "],["733.92","might be new to you but he eavesdrops he "],["737.88","hears Every Idle Word and and he takes "],["740.04","it personally "],["741.3","so even those things that were just "],["744.839","speaking in confidence here that's "],["747.24","actually something that God overhears "],["749.22","and he he's you know very aware of Jesus "],["754.5","said in Matthew 12 but I say to you that "],["757.14","for Every Idle Word "],["759.959","that men speak they will give an account "],["762.3","for it on the day of judgment "],["765.779","for by your words you will be justified "],["767.88","and by your words you will be condemned "],["771.899","so it's some comfort that uh this isn't "],["776.519","the first time in history that people "],["778.079","have spoken against God you know all you "],["780.3","have to do is go on Facebook you go on "],["782.339","uh the the uh the news you hear people "],["786.42","that are are raging that are upset "],["788.459","because uh something happened you know "],["790.92","how dare God do this "],["793.56","uh Jude talks about that and actually "],["796.38","harks back to Enoch who's uh if you look "],["799.38","at the genealogy he's a seventh in line "],["802.019","from Adam he prophesied about these men "],["805.2","also saying behold "],["807.3","the Lord comes with ten thousand of his "],["810.06","Saints "],["811.44","to execute judgment on all to convict "],["814.139","all who are ungodly among them of all "],["817.139","their ungodly Deeds "],["819.6","which they have committed in an ungodly "],["821.7","way and of all the harsh things "],["824.76","which ungodly Sinners had spoken against "],["826.92","him "],["829.68","so the prevailing opinion back in Israel "],["832.16","just like it is today was that it's "],["834.66","useless to serve God "],["836.88","yeah it's a waste of time it's a waste "],["838.98","of energy it's a waste of resources it "],["841.68","cramps my style you know it's such a "],["844.139","down or even to the point of being "],["845.94","mournful "],["848.579","wipe it yourself through all that "],["850.5","trouble "],["851.339","all that emotional pain "],["855.899","get out there and live life "],["858.18","don't worry about serving God or being "],["860.279","concerned about his things "],["863.579","and I realize kind of preaching to the "],["866.519","choir here some of you may be getting "],["868.139","overwhelmed with doing well "],["870.24","you know thinking that all the time you "],["872.94","spend at church serving in Awana serving "],["876","in the nursery teaching Sunday School "],["878.639","leading a small group it's just too much "],["882.18","and we get Battle weary sometimes "],["884.82","they're raising kids praying serving on "],["888.06","the AV team serving on the worship team "],["890.519","witnessing or giving "],["894","and there's always more needs right "],["895.8","there's always more hands that are being "],["900.42","held out for us to to give "],["904.019","we used to have a small group in our "],["905.88","home you know for many years and "],["908.04","Wednesday nights where it was always a "],["909.66","rush you know it was always trying to "],["911.82","get the house in order trying to set "],["913.98","things up for folks to come we enjoyed "],["916.74","it immensely it was a lot of good "],["919.74","Fellowship but it was a lot of work too "],["922.279","and some of you who are hosting even now "],["925.32","know what I mean "],["926.76","uh once once everyone left we were "],["929.1","exhausted "],["931.5","but look at what folks were saying back "],["933.839","in Malachi's time "],["935.94","verse 15 so now we call the proud "],["938.699","blessed "],["940.92","for those who do wickedness are raised "],["943.199","up even they tempt God and they go free "],["947.88","folks who are out doing their own thing "],["949.86","and living for the present are blessed "],["952.8","they're getting ahead "],["955.079","you know Only the Good Die Young right "],["958.62","the survival of the fittest you only go "],["961.44","around once so you might as well enjoy "],["963.06","it "],["964.26","follow your heart "],["966.24","don't concern yourself with anyone else "],["968.459","especially God and even though the "],["971.399","scriptures say you know do not uh you "],["974.22","you shall not tempt the Lord your God "],["976.019","those who tempt him uh do suffer no "],["980.22","adverse consequences they're getting "],["982.32","away with it "],["984.54","and they're even getting ahead "],["987.8","the other day I was waiting for I know "],["991.139","conference rooms are sort of in short "],["993","supply at our our one building and one "],["996.779","of the gals and I were kind of waiting "],["998.279","around got talking about what we're "],["1000.62","doing over the weekend what happened as "],["1003.38","it turned out we had to meet emissions "],["1005.24","staff meeting uh Friday night and then "],["1008.3","Saturday was a planning uh Retreat for "],["1012.079","the school and then Sunday Tina and I "],["1015.259","went over visited brother John Funk who "],["1017.42","was just getting out of surgery and and "],["1020.18","uh good good visit to fellowship with

we got you know the conference room "],["1035.78","opened up so that's where we went but um "],["1039.799","I thought you know this is my life you "],["1042.559","know this is this is the way we roll "],["1044.12","This is we do this all the time you know "],["1046.22","doing good is is what God's called us to "],["1049.16","do uh not just once in a while not just "],["1051.74","you know a weekend a month or whatever "],["1053.54","uh this is this is how "],["1056.78","um we live our lives you know and I know "],["1059.36","this is true of many folks in this room "],["1061.64","today you know this is uh you're doing "],["1064.46","good is just part of who you are in "],["1066.98","Christ "],["1068.059","uh Paul says in Galatians you know "],["1070.52","therefore as we have opportunity let us "],["1072.44","do good to all "],["1073.88","especially to those who are of the "],["1076.039","household of faith "],["1077.72","you know that's uh you know you're "],["1080.179","consuming yourselves with ministering to "],["1083","others "],["1084.98","sometimes at the point of exhaustion "],["1089.6","so what do believers do in this type of "],["1092.179","toxic environment "],["1094.16","when public opinion is so stacked "],["1096.38","against serving God "],["1099.74","how do Believers respond "],["1103.179","David says in Psalm 11 you know if the "],["1106.16","foundations be destroyed "],["1108.799","what can the righteous do "],["1110.9","yeah it's just not not worth the "],["1113.72","struggle right "],["1114.98","do they retreat in fear "],["1118.64","do they cower into silence to avoid "],["1120.74","offending someone "],["1122.539","do they resign themselves to becoming "],["1124.76","just another statistic "],["1128.24","are they paralyzed because someone might "],["1130.34","disagree with what they believe or the "],["1132.2","way they invest their money or their "],["1133.76","time "],["1136.52","verse 16 then those who feared the Lord "],["1139.72","spoke to one another "],["1144.08","those who fear the lord spoke to one "],["1146.539","another they didn't shut down "],["1149.12","in spite of the culture those who feared "],["1151.88","the Lord spoke to one another they "],["1154.22","communicated truly with one another they "],["1157.1","shared their lives with one another they "],["1159.74","made communing together "],["1162.5","a priority "],["1165.919","let us consider one another in order to "],["1169.16","stir up love and good works "],["1171.919","not forsaking the assembling of "],["1173.96","ourselves together as the manner of some "],["1175.94","is "],["1177.62","but exhorting one another and so much "],["1179.96","the more "],["1181.1","as you see the day approaching "],["1186.679","Believers recognize their need for one "],["1188.78","another "],["1189.679","they stirred each other up to love they "],["1192.62","stirred each other up to Good Works they "],["1194.539","got together often they encouraged each "],["1197.12","other especially as the day of his "],["1199.64","return approaches "],["1202.1","it's our great hope speaking to one "],["1204.559","another in Psalms and hymns and "],["1206.96","spiritual songs singing and making "],["1209.12","melody in your heart to the Lord "],["1212.539","therefore put away lying "],["1215.36","Let each one of you speak truth with his "],["1218","neighbor why "],["1220.58","because we're members one of another "],["1223.34","you know we're connected as things get "],["1225.38","darker outside you know the the "],["1228.02","fellowship the interaction the support "],["1230.26","of the body of Christ becomes even more "],["1233.12","precious and vital "],["1235.039","you know it's how we continue how we how "],["1237.86","we work How We Roll Believers reminded "],["1241.16","themselves of God's truth they "],["1243.62","encouraged each other to stay true to "],["1245.78","the Lord "],["1247.1","it was not lost on Believers of that day "],["1249.74","that they were in the minority "],["1251.84","they were not oblivious to the culture "],["1254.32","but that was okay "],["1257.179","the prevailing opinion was not going to "],["1259.16","dampen their Zeal for God and for each "],["1261.2","other "],["1262.46","they would speak "],["1264.26","even if it was unpopular "],["1266.78","and in spite of the pop of the "],["1269.12","opposition "],["1270.86","and so how did the Lord respond "],["1274.4","the Lord listened and he heard them "],["1277.94","so here again just as we saw in verses 8 "],["1280.7","and 11 God's listening in "],["1283.039","this time he's listening to those who "],["1285.2","fear Him "],["1286.46","he pays attention he knows our plate "],["1289.76","he identifies with our exclusion "],["1293.48","just as he knew the plight of the "],["1295.1","children of Israel in Egypt "],["1298.4","this is what God said to Moses the Lord "],["1301.82","said I have surely seen "],["1304.28","the oppression of my people who are in "],["1306.38","Egypt I've heard their cry "],["1308.539","because of their task Masters "],["1311.179","for I know their sorrows "],["1314.299","you know I have seen the oppression "],["1316.58","I've heard their cry "],["1318.74","I know their sorrows "],["1321.26","so it's not lost on God what's going on "],["1323.72","he's acutely aware "],["1326.659","and so what did God do "],["1329.78","Malachi 3 again so a book of remembrance "],["1332.38","was written before him "],["1335.24","for those who fear the lord and for "],["1337.34","those who meditate on his name "],["1341.059","he writes it down "],["1343.58","he records what was said "],["1345.86","what we think is a passing conversation "],["1348.2","or a word without import becomes a "],["1351.86","permanent record "],["1354.14","a lasting Legacy is established infused "],["1357.38","with eternal significance "],["1360.14","and why "],["1362.36","because they fear the lord "],["1364.94","and they meditate on his name "],["1368.9","David said oh how I love your law it's "],["1371.36","my meditation all the day "],["1375.5","but his Delight is in the law of the "],["1377.6","Lord and in his law he meditates day and "],["1381.559","night you know he's constantly "],["1383.72","ruminating thinking through uh what God "],["1386.9","says about things resetting realigning "],["1390.02","our thinking to "],["1392.44","what God has prescribed "],["1395.659","so those seemingly insignificant verses "],["1398.36","of scripture words of encouragement to a "],["1401.9","brother or sister who's struggling "],["1404.24","they end up making a huge Eternal "],["1407.179","difference in their lives "],["1409.76","and then notice What God Says "],["1413.299","verse 17 they shall be mine "],["1415.82","so that's the Lord of hosts on the day "],["1418.28","that I make them my jewels "],["1422.36","and I will spare them as a man spares "],["1424.82","his own son who serves him "],["1428.72","they shall be mine "],["1431.36","that's

"],["2286.119","his commands is to remember him "],["2288.82","through the practice of the Lord's table "],["2290.44","so if I can get some ushers to join me "],["2293.02","up here that would be neat "],["2298.54","oh "],["2300.099","the big things he asks us to do is not "],["2303.28","be ashamed of his name and to remember "],["2305.44","the things that he's done "],["2308.02","and he gives us again just images of "],["2310.48","that and so we do communion "],["2313.119","again it's an open communion you don't "],["2315.52","have to be a member so if there's anyone "],["2317.2","visiting here you're you know Jesus "],["2319.119","Christ as your savior you're welcome to "],["2321.46","do this with us and again it does come "],["2323.619","with a warning if there's something that

"],["24.06","looking at the list of subs today and he "],["25.859","knew I was going to be following the "],["26.699","kids choir he went that one will fit put "],["29.279","him in there "],["30.42","so uh "],["32.579","I am an adult I promise "],["35.34","but when I was growing up "],["37.38","I struggled to sit in a class of any "],["40.379","kind "],["41.399","I was a hyperactive kid who understood "],["43.98","Concepts very quickly and I would get "],["46.92","annoyed with things that took too long "],["48.48","or were too slow for my brain "],["50.76","so this meant that I acted out my "],["53.46","parents had the wise forethought to "],["56.64","homeschool me for my own good "],["59.579","um an interesting phenomenon that occurs "],["61.62","when you tell a kid that he's a problem "],["63.899","he continues to be a problem "],["67.14","and if I was going to be a bad kid "],["69.479","was a problem "],["71.34","you bet I was going to be the best at it "],["74.58","so I leaned into the role that I was "],["76.2","being cast in "],["78","and I suppose that doing that was a "],["79.86","small revenge for being made to feel "],["81.24","that way by adults who were convinced "],["82.979","that that's what I was "],["85.439","and my goal in those instances was not "],["87.72","to be well pleasing but rather the "],["89.939","opposite "],["91.619","what people viewed me as and the way "],["93.72","that they perceived me "],["95.34","bothered me still does honestly to this "],["98.1","day "],["99.299","uh I struggled for a long time to not "],["102.72","try and please others "],["104.52","and there's been a lot of my life that "],["106.2","I've done that "],["107.7","I wish I hadn't given up on I gave up on "],["110.04","piano because people laughed at me "],["111.6","because I wasn't very good at it I "],["114.24","didn't read comic books when I was a kid "],["115.68","because I was led to believe that those "],["117.06","were for weirdos "],["118.74","I didn't realize I was one at the time "],["120.54","so "],["121.86","you know it's not that far off I would "],["124.14","constantly try to laugh at my own "],["125.46","shortcomings because maybe if I laugh at "],["127.439","myself first other people won't laugh at "],["129.119","me as much or they'll be pleased with me "],["131.16","because they get to laugh at me too "],["133.62","it always felt like Their Eyes Were "],["135.42","Watching and waiting to laugh at me "],["138.54","and it's interesting because my my "],["140.099","students the other day they asked me hey "],["143.04","can you take us outside and me being the "],["145.379","cool teacher that I am said sure if we "],["147.959","can make it through our lesson without "],["149.04","interruption "],["150.72","and so they quickly interrupted me "],["154.319","and I was like what happened to going "],["156.42","outside "],["157.56","that lasted for like 30 seconds and one "],["159.78","of the kids went well we knew we weren't "],["162.18","going to make it anyway "],["166.26","and that hit me very hard because I "],["168.06","would have thought something very "],["168.9","similar at their age "],["170.519","people go through their lives trying to "],["172.98","be pleasing to others "],["174.78","we try to please parents teachers bosses "],["178.08","police pastors or peers "],["184.019","or maybe you're like me and you just "],["186.239","stop trying to be pleasing because you "],["187.98","know you're not going to come up or "],["188.94","you're going to come up short "],["190.86","and the idea of the eyes of others "],["192.599","watching me may have been paranoia "],["195.959","but maybe it wasn't "],["197.64","regardless those are not the eyes that I "],["199.92","should have been concerned about "],["202.379","if you have your Bibles please turn to "],["204.36","Second Corinthians chapter five we're "],["207","going to be looking at verses 9 through "],["208.2","11. "],["209.459","second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 "],["211.86","through 11. "],["213.3","now for context because "],["216.12","context is very important the Corinthian "],["218.76","Church "],["220.799","is a very interesting Church let's put "],["222.84","it that way throughout First Corinthians "],["225.299","we see that the church is engaging in "],["227.7","terrible behaviors they're distorting "],["229.68","the grace of God and they're using God's "],["231.959","grace for their own vanity and so "],["233.819","throughout First Corinthians Paul is "],["235.86","writing in order to set some of these "],["237.78","ideologies "],["239.819","straight "],["241.26","and so he spends a lot of First "],["242.58","Corinthians correcting them and the goal "],["245.099","of that is that there might be Unity "],["246.36","within the body instead of division "],["248.58","and so "],["250.08","First Corinthians is a remarkable book "],["252.36","about the mindset of a Christian and "],["254.459","it's important to understand that "],["255.48","context as we move into second "],["256.979","Corinthians "],["259.139","because in second Corinthians Paul's "],["261","subject matter is similar but different "],["264.18","sorry similar in some ways but overall "],["266.04","it's different you see in the first "],["267.9","letter he addressed issues with the "],["269.94","church and then some of the people "],["272.639","did not really like that "],["274.56","you see I've learned that church people "],["276.18","don't like when you touch your touch "],["277.74","their stuff "],["280.139","so the people that didn't like it "],["282.6","started accusing Paul of being a false "],["284.699","prophet and they were they just claiming "],["286.919","that he had no authority to actually "],["288.6","correct them and they were like you know "],["290.58","this guy he talks all big and bad when "],["292.259","he's in the letter but he won't you know "],["295.08","when he's in person "],["296.88","he won't come at it yeah he can't back "],["298.5","it up "],["300.72","and so second Corinthians "],["303.6","is written "],["305.04","to address that but it's also written "],["307.199","because these people that were claiming "],["308.58","that Paul was a false prophet were also "],["311.88","changing parts of the gospel and so Paul "],["315.66","writes back to defend his apostleship "],["317.639","and address "],["319.139","those doctrinal issues in the section we "],["321.78","find ourselves in today is specifically "],["323.46","addressing why the apostles endure "],["325.62","everything "],["327.84","and when we look at the work of the "],["329.46","Apostles "],["330.78","why did they do it why did they do "],["333.3","everything they did I mean they were "],["335.1","beaten exiled cast out of cities stoned "],["339.419","crucified beheaded "],["342.06","other ways of killing people because I'm "],["343.919","not very imaginative "],["345.6","uh only one Apostle died a natural death "],["349.32","and even he died in Exile on the island "],["351.419","of Patmos "],["353.82","so being an apostle you could say is not "],["356.52","good for one's health "],["359.16","and they didn't own property "],["361.38","they had no finances "],["363.84","and they had they didn't have families "],["366.419","so according to the American dream "],["368.88","they were failures "],["372.12","why did they do it "],["374.039","well "],["375.36","it's simply "],["377.28","for the sake of the Gospel "],["380.4","for the sake of the Gospel they were "],["381.9","willing to be beaten and endure "],["383.699","hardships "],["385.68","First Corinthians 4 10 says we were "],["388.38","fools we are fools for Christ's sake "],["392.46","they were considered fools for the sake "],["394.8","of others coming to Christ "],["397.38","they had this assurance from Christ that "],["399.96","what was present was not the only thing "],["402.06","whether there was a greater weight of "],["404.88","Glory coming "],["406.62","it reminds me of the hymn Blessed "],["409.08","assurance Jesus is mine oh what a "],["411.78","foretaste of Glory divine "],["414.479","and with this assurance they went forth "],["416.4","with boldness and now this is the "],["418.62","context that we enter into so second "],["420.78","Corinthians 5 9-11 "],["423.419","so whether we are at home or away we "],["426.84","make it our aim to please him "],["429.06","for we must all appear before the "],["430.8","Judgment seat of Christ so each one may "],["433.139","receive what is due for what he has done "],["434.699","in the body whether good or evil "],["436.08","therefore knowing the fear of the Lord "],["438.539","we persuade others but what we are is "],["441.3","known "],["442.38","to you or to God and we hope it is known "],["444.96","also to your conscience "],["447.18","now verse 9 starts with a focus on Homer "],["449.94","away "],["451.199","for those of you that may be confused "],["452.88","this refers to present on Earth or "],["456","present in heaven "],["458.639","and I love the phrase that follows "],["460.86","we make it our aim to please him "],["465.479","you can almost see Paul saying this to "],["467.22","his accusers "],["468.9","Paul would not have cared for this "],["470.34","scrutiny because they are not the ones "],["472.08","he is concerned about "],["473.58","his goal was to please God in his life "],["477.36","or in his death "],["479.819","we aim to be pleasing to him now "],["483.3","aim implies effort and implies "],["486.72","forethought and implies a fixed point "],["489.539","that one's eyes are focused on "],["493.02","aiming implies that something will "],["495.72","happen "],["497.039","and gun safety courses you are "],["498.9","instructed to not aim at anything you "],["500.699","are not willing to destroy "],["502.5","because depending on how bad of a shot "],["504.84","you are when you aim at something "],["507.36","you generally hit "],["509.4","in that vicinity especially when you're "],["511.44","aiming a gun "],["512.64","you literally will destroy it "],["514.979","so "],["516.959","you ain't been nothing "],["518.88","you hit nothing every time "],["522.12","and I personally have been struggling "],["524.7","lately with this idea of aiming "],["526.8","because "],["528.66","I feel like I don't really have an aim "],["530.22","in my life "],["531.779","and I I had my whole life planned out "],["534","you know I was like I'm gonna go to "],["536.22","college I'm going to get my degree I'm "],["538.62","gonna graduate get a job in Ministry and "],["541.14","I'm gonna just do that until I die "],["543.959","that's it that's the whole plan "],["545.76","and so "],["547.56","that didn't quite happen the way I "],["549.12","thought it would I was working in "],["550.32","Ministry for a while "],["552.42","and I loved it but things happened and I "],["556.38","had to leave that job "],["558.72","and the worst part was I couldn't even "],["561.12","find a career job "],["562.86","I had a four-year degree from an "],["564.959","accredited University I applied to "],["567.3","Everything Under the Sun and nobody "],["569.04","wanted me "],["571.14","I ended up working at Sheets making subs "],["576.08","I eventually got promoted to a manager "],["578.7","because you know when you have a brain "],["580.08","people notice "],["581.339","and so I got promoted to a manager and "],["584.7","then I did that for a while until I got "],["586.2","a job teaching at King's Christian "],["587.519","Academy "],["589.86","and now I'm at this Crossroads because "],["595.14","do I try to go back into vocational "],["597.18","Ministry "],["598.56","do I stay with education which I'm "],["600.42","currently doing and I I enjoy it "],["602.7","or do I do something else entirely "],["606.06","and since I'm working through all of "],["608.1","these "],["609","questions "],["610.74","I feel like I don't have an aim "],["613.08","like a marksman without a Target "],["618.12","however "],["619.74","even if my career does not have a name "],["622.56","my life does "],["625.86","my life is to be pleasing to him "],["631.2","and this transcends all other things in "],["633.06","my life "],["634.38","I can't afford to sit and do nothing "],["636.54","because I don't have an excuse "],["639.42","no matter no matter what career I am in "],["642.899","am I pleasing to the Lord "],["646.2","am I pleasing to him as a father "],["648.6","and husband "],["650.94","what about interacting with strangers "],["653.76","am I pleasing to the Lord "],["656.76","the reality is is that it's very easy to "],["659.399","seek to please oneself and it frequently "],["662.1","happens when we don't even notice it "],["664.26","I learned that it's possible to be in "],["666.66","Ministry and not be pleasing to the Lord "],["670.459","I learned that some people don't "],["673.38","Minister honestly "],["677.519","are is the ministry that you're "],["679.079","performing is it for your benefit "],["681.779","or for the Lords "],["684.6","are you serving because it makes you "],["687.18","feel good "],["689.279","have you ever considered the well-being "],["690.72","of the people you're serving "],["692.579","or is it just about how it makes you "],["694.079","feel "],["695.519","is it for Christ's Glory or for yours "],["699.839","what does your attitude reflect "],["702.779","now God can use Ministry in any form "],["705.42","from a variety of attitudes we see that "],["707.94","in Philippians 1. when people are "],["710.519","spreading the gospel despite Paul and "],["713.16","Paul's like yeah keep spiting me please "],["716.279","because the gospel is going forth "],["718.92","but that's still possible to not be "],["720.899","pleasing to the Lord "],["723.48","and to be pleasing with him "],["725.64","starts with a relationship "],["728.04","and this is done through faith Hebrews "],["730.74","11 6 says without faith it is impossible "],["735.12","to please God "],["738.66","and how are we supposed to "],["741.24","teach others about someone we've never "],["743.579","met "],["745.26","in the great Divorce by C.S Lewis which "],["747.48","I've been reading lately because I'm way "],["748.74","behind on my theological readings "],["751.019","he has a section where he's talking "],["752.579","about these people that "],["754.8","through intellectual exercise and and "],["757.14","thinking and you know having a huge "],["759.66","brain "],["760.68","they are like yeah we'll defend God and "],["763.74","we'll "],["764.76","we'll make sure that other people know "],["766.26","about him and that we can prove the "],["767.459","existence of God "],["769.2","but they didn't know who he was "],["772.74","and there are people out there that "],["774.42","evangelize and tell people about Christ "],["776.279","but never "],["777.48","ask the question of "],["779.7","well who is he and coming to know him "],["781.98","himself it is possible to serve and not "],["785.76","know Christ "],["788.04","and the closer we get to God "],["790.38","the more we love things that he loves "],["793.32","like justice mercy and humility "],["799.019","and obtaining just those three "],["800.519","attributes will take us years "],["803.94","it simplifies to this if you want to be "],["806.519","pleasing to God "],["808.26","Duty commands "],["811.019","however "],["813.6","do we do good things "],["816.36","or do we strive to be good "],["821.16","because there is an inherent difference "],["822.48","between those two things one is focused "],["825","on the outer action "],["826.8","but there's never a change on the n-word "],["828.36","the other focuses on the inward change "],["830.76","and out of that change the outward "],["832.74","changes "],["835.98","and I feel like in general "],["838.2","speaking from my experience "],["840.06","churches and even Christian Schools they "],["843","focus on the behavior "],["844.92","it's always sit down stop talking listen "],["849.66","did you memorize your Bible verse "],["855.24","but they never asked the question of is "],["857.76","the heart changing "],["859.38","because what ends up happening with "],["860.76","those kids that behave and they're good "],["862.44","and whatever "],["863.76","they end up getting older "],["865.92","as all do "],["868.26","and then they have the opportunity to "],["869.94","act without repercussions at least "],["871.86","repercussions they can perceive and what "],["873.839","do they do "],["876","they behave accordingly because the "],["878.519","inward part was never addressed "],["881.339","we only change the outside actions "],["884.339","and so I believe that the church as a "],["886.74","whole focused too much on the outward "],["888.6","but forget about the n-word "],["890.639","now we host Celebrate Recovery here at "],["892.56","the church we also host a bunch of "],["895.139","sexual recovery groups "],["897.12","and do you know what's taught in those "],["898.8","groups "],["900.06","does change come from the outside of the "],["901.92","inside "],["903.36","the inside the battle is not out here "],["906.36","the battle's up here it's in the brain "],["909.72","and behavior does not change "],["912.779","from the outside sure we might be able "],["914.639","to control it but eventually we're going "],["916.199","to just go back to what we were doing "],["918.06","true change must come from within "],["922.019","in order to be good one has to face the "],["926.04","difficulties inside honestly "],["929.279","there must be a relationship with Christ "],["931.38","because he reveals "],["933.899","our sin to us he prompts us and he "],["937.019","strengthens us to put the old man to "],["939.6","death "],["941.399","Charles Spurgeon once said "],["943.68","the nearer a man lives to God the more "],["946.92","intensely he has or

"],["958.68","the first is that sin becomes so "],["961.079","disgusting to us to the point that we "],["962.639","mourn its existence and seek to change "],["964.44","it "],["965.16","and that comes from drawing closer to "],["968.1","God "],["968.88","however there's a second part of that "],["970.5","the second is that we continue to grow "],["972.36","closer to God "],["973.74","and as we do the smaller sins bother us "],["977.04","more "],["978.72","because I don't know if any of you can "],["980.459","remember when you were first a Christian "],["982.68","when you first came to Christ when you "],["984.36","first realized "],["986.82","the sinfulness of your own heart "],["989.519","there were big things you had to deal "],["991.26","with "],["992.1","there were big things that had

"],["1059.6","our existence we don't cease to exist we "],["1062.48","just change locations "],["1065.78","death is just a doorway "],["1068.179","to take us to the next place "],["1072.34","and

be pleasing to God and "],["1085.28","that starts today "],["1088.82","now in verse 10. "],["1090.86","it says that we all must stand before "],["1092.539","God in judgment "],["1094.4","and this is the reason that Paul is "],["1096.98","giving to be pleasing to God "],["1099.5","the reasons are "],["1101.299","because that were all dying "],["1104.299","some of us at different rates "],["1107.059","and that we will all stand before God "],["1109.24","completely exposed "],["1112.82","which "],["1114.58","at uh KCA Mr Somerville had a poster in "],["1118.34","the window to his office that said "],["1120.62","character is who you are when no one is

"],["1287.12","we're not going to get into that because "],["1288.02","we're not in a literature class okay "],["1290","we're taking the the principle here "],["1292.76","because the principle of

and "],["1420.32","we see that day approaching "],["1423.32","now we are at a very strange point in "],["1426.14","our nation's history "],["1428.179","as the world "],["1429.98","seems to get more sinful "],["1433.4","we also find "],["1435.14","that there are a lot of people looking "],["1436.4","for meaning and Hope "],["1440.6","they often find it in the wrong places "],["1443.539","but people are looking "],["1446.78","now I get annoyed with people I get "],["1449.6","annoyed with politics and the fact that "],["1451.64","those two things go together just makes "],["1452.84","them worse "],["1454.88","but this trend is growing people are "],["1458.659","trying to find Community they're trying "],["1460.94","to find purpose they want to feel "],["1463.22","special and to feel like they're making "],["1464.6","a difference "],["1465.98","the ways are often very wrong "],["1470.419","but we see the whole world aches for "],["1473.179","Christ they may deny it "],["1476.419","but they need him "],["1479.6","and I have found that many Christians "],["1481.88","have this weird defeated attitude like "],["1484.34","America's forever lost or something and "],["1486.74","so because America has lost we've lost "],["1490.34","I mean "],["1491.72","a new law came out that "],["1494.659","opens the door for Christians to pastors "],["1498.14","potentially be persecuted for not "],["1499.52","marrying homosexuals "],["1502.52","does that sound like winning "],["1506.539","however there's a few things wrong with "],["1508.4","this assumption "],["1509.9","the first is that it ties "],["1512.12","Christianity to America "],["1514.94","Christianity is not American "],["1518.539","it transcends borders cultures and "],["1523.039","languages I mean the church started in "],["1525.74","Israel moved to Antioch and then spread "],["1528.32","out from there across Europe Asia and "],["1531.32","Africa "],["1533.059","and as part of the

"],["1560.779","they're using the wrong measurements "],["1563.539","we forget "],["1565.4","that Christ "],["1566.96","shall reign "],["1569.12","we have this assurance "],["1571.1","Christ will

"],["1614.48","you want to be pleasing to God "],["1617.24","then you must love what he loves "],["1619.76","and Christ died for all "],["1621.98","out of love "],["1623.9","so therefore you must love

there "],["42.879","we're at the end of summer we're going "],["44.239","to be seeing the leaves change we're "],["45.92","going to see the glory and magnificence "],["47.84","of christ "],["49.28","as he "],["50.559","changes world "],["52.48","and changes "],["54.079","our environment but it's still beautiful "],["57.12","and every way that he has created "],["60.719","so "],["62.96","i was watching the youtube "],["65.84","of pastor as he was "],["68.24","speaking last week and i wanted to make "],["70.479","sure that i didn't talk about the same "],["71.92","thing

"],["80.08","but i'm going to take it just a little "],["82.24","bit of a different twist "],["85.6","and i'm going to be looking at matthew "],["87.6","14. so if you'd like to open up there "],["90.24","we'll "],["91.04","recap that just a quick second "],["95.119","about halfway down in "],["97.36","matthew 14 starting around "],["99.68","verse 22 "],["102.4","we see this wonderful big

"],["130.399","but there's more than just what i "],["132.4","outlined "],["133.76","there is "],["135.52","a lot in there so let's let's break that "],["137.76","down for a little bit "],["140.48","so that we can build you back up "],["144.08","matthew 14 "],["146","verse 22 it says "],["148.239","immediately jesus made the wait amen "],["151.84","immediately "],["153.36","that's

"],["163.68","we're seeing jesus "],["166.4","feeding 5 000 people "],["170.08","it just says five thousand men of course "],["171.76","we all know "],["172.879","that it's a lot more than that i'm sure "],["175.04","there were kids and ladies there as well "],["178.08","but jesus didn't stop there "],["180.959","he is "],["182.239","blessing them he is showing these people "],["185.519","and

been "],["316.72","praying over and over and over again "],["318.639","that i would get to like this guy and "],["320.72","that he would get to like me that we "],["322.479","would be able to work together a lot "],["324.08","more "],["325.84","when he put in his resignation "],["330.16","everybody put their phones on mutant "],["331.919","gold "],["334.08","okay "],["334.96","but "],["336.16","i fell to my knees "],["339.68","i had a god who delivered me "],["343.12","and i continued on with that company for "],["345.12","a few more months because then they went "],["346.639","out of business but that's another story "],["348.4","for another day "],["350.4","and frankly that's how i got here "],["352.639","we moved up to maryland "],["356.639","but the disciples "],["358.479","had seen this wonderful lesson "],["361.919","that jesus had done "],["365.68","and "],["366.479","the crowd was rejoicing "],["369.36","at the fact that they were a part of "],["372.56","this fantastically large "],["375.44","miracle "],["378.319","and they were ready to crown jesus king "],["382.16","because they wanted to throw off the "],["384","romans "],["385.199","and get rid of herod "],["387.039","to get rid of that "],["389.68","shall we say deep state "],["392.479","of government "],["394.8","sorry didn't mean to get into politics "],["396.96","there but i think "],["398.639","this kind of thing goes round and round "],["400.16","all the time "],["404.72","so he sent the disciples "],["407.36","immediately "],["409.12","into the boat "],["410.479","and go row off the disciples had a "],["413.039","million questions the first thing was "],["415.36","they wanted to be a part of this "],["417.039","rejoicing "],["419.599","but their lord and master said no we "],["421.36","need to get you separated and get you "],["423.68","going "],["425.199","but he also wanted to dismiss the crowd "],["428.8","and send them on their way and the third "],["430.8","thing he wanted to do was go up onto the "],["432.72","mountain "],["433.84","and praise god "],["435.599","for the people who are "],["437.759","engaged and blessing him you know "],["441.28","he's blessing them actually the the "],["443.52","point is is that "],["445.52","he wanted to be with his father "],["449.039","and say thank you "],["451.68","thank you for letting "],["453.28","them be a part "],["454.88","of all of this thank you for letting me "],["456.88","be a part with them "],["459.68","because they needed it so bad "],["464.16","but he had the disciples in the boat "],["467.44","and the disciples are rowing "],["469.599","you know the old song row row your boat "],["473.52","that's a big lake "],["477.44","it took them "],["478.23","[Music] "],["479.36","hours to get out of the view of where "],["482.4","they were "],["483.919","but now we have a storm brewing up "],["487.919","and this storm "],["490","is into the headwind they're they're not "],["492.639","going with the storm they're going "],["494.16","against the storm "],["497.44","but as they're going into this they're "],["499.44","rowing harder and harder and they're not "],["502.319","really making a lot of progress "],["506.08","the big problem was that it's now "],["509.44","getting dark "],["511.44","and this storm is among them and the "],["514.159","waves are just crashing over and over "],["516.88","and spilling into the boat i love "],["518.64","teaching kids visual stories like this "],["521.599","they all understand "],["523.76","they've been in little canoes and little "],["525.44","boats and swimming pools and whatever "],["526.959","have you before "],["528.32","and the waves "],["530","kind of you know it's like a carnival "],["532.16","except in this case with the disciples "],["535.44","they're terrorized "],["537.839","and they're in this "],["539.6","trying to row against the wind against "],["542.16","the waves it's filling up and "],["544.399","bartholomew is saying to simon have you "],["546.399","got a bucket we're starting to fill up "],["548.64","we got to get rid of this "],["551.519","but that wasn't the lesson that jesus "],["554.16","was trying to tell them "],["556.399","but what we do convey is that there's "],["558.64","going to be hard times pastor was "],["561.2","talking about that last week "],["564.88","we are still going to engage in a lot of "],["567.519","hard times "],["573.6","he also wanted the the disciples to be "],["577.04","separated from the people for a purpose "],["580.24","he wanted them to ponder "],["583.44","what jesus had just done "],["585.92","the feeding of the five thousand "],["588.88","he wanted them to sit down and think "],["592.8","about "],["593.76","what had just happened "],["598.24","they had seen this gargantuan miracle "],["602.24","and they wanted jesus wanted them to "],["604.399","talk amongst themselves "],["607.36","to talk about what had happened "],["610.08","when miraculous things happen to us "],["612.959","and when great things happen to us the "],["614.959","things that kind of drop us to our knees "],["618.16","we need to ponder "],["620","and pray about this and rejoice to the "],["622.32","lord "],["623.2","lord you engaged me in this "],["626.64","i'm a part of this "],["628.959","thank you "],["631.12","thank you for letting me see "],["633.279","just a glimpse "],["635.519","of what you provide "],["638.399","billions of people every day "],["641.2","and i'm part of that "],["644.959","so the the disciples are pondering and "],["647.839","the bible says it continues on it says "],["649.839","later that night he jesus who was alone "],["653.839","and the boat was already a considerable "],["656.48","distance from the land "],["658.48","buffeted by waves because the wind was "],["661.279","against it "],["662.56","shortly before dawn "],["664.32","jesus went out to them "],["666.399","walking on the lake "],["669.12","i'm going to stop there just for a "],["670.64","second "],["671.519","picture that in your mind "],["674.8","this horrific storm is about to sink "],["677.44","this little dinghy "],["680.399","and the apostles the disciples and then "],["682.64","the all the other followers "],["684.64","are wondering what is going to happen in "],["688","the next few minutes before they sink "],["694.959","the funny thing was "],["698.079","jesus was already on his way out to see "],["701.12","them "],["703.36","where jesus was on the side of that "],["705.36","mountain "],["706.56","was four miles away from where the boat "],["708.88","was in the middle of the sea the lake "],["713.519","jesus walked on water for over three "],["716.079","miles "],["719.6","i have a hard time swimming three miles "],["722.32","much less walking three miles "],["724.959","and "],["726","jesus was doing it on "],["728.16","the ocean "],["729.76","in the waves in the storm "],["733.2","jesus had no concern it wasn't his time "],["735.36","yet of course "],["737.36","but there's also something else that was "],["739.12","going on "],["740.639","and at around three o'clock to six "],["743.12","o'clock in the morning it was the fourth "],["744.48","watch "],["746.32","the apostles are still stroking away "],["748.88","trying to get to the other side and the "],["751.2","thought occurred to some of them "],["752.639","probably "],["753.92","hey jesus is walking around all of this "],["756.88","why did he make us "],["759.04","come into the middle of this chaos "],["763.44","and almost get drowned "],["766.399","but then "],["769.36","then the apostles look out and they see "],["773.279","way off in the distance "],["776.72","a figure "],["778.32","as sailors in the time "],["780.399","they lived through that superstition "],["783.12","about "],["784.8","if someone drowns in the ocean "],["789.04","then their ghost will haunt that area "],["791.2","forever "],["792.639","are they floating in part of that ocean "],["795.279","where those ghosts are "],["797.76","and they're looking out "],["799.6","like you remember the casper the "],["801.519","friendly ghosts "],["803.04","cartoons when we were kids "],["805.2","some of you are still kids but that's "],["807.12","that's the end "],["808.8","and the person goes "],["810.8","a good ghost and they start screaming "],["813.44","and going crazy well they didn't have "],["815.839","very far to go so they were stuck in the "],["817.68","boat "],["818.639","and they're going a ghost "],["821.12","they're saying the exact same thing "],["828.56","but jesus says "],["830.48","a very profound thing at that moment "],["833.44","he knew "],["834.88","that there was fear in their hearts "],["837.92","and he says "],["839.12","take courage "],["841.12","it is i "],["842.88","don't be "],["844.399","afraid "],["849.519","we as christians and followers of christ "],["853.04","how can we not be afraid sometimes "],["856.959","we've got idiots driving back and forth "],["858.88","on the highway "],["860.48","i'd be afraid too i drove an hour to get "],["862.88","here "],["865.68","you know that story and of course you "],["867.6","got the guys going up the the "],["869.6","anyway we're not going to go there "],["872.079","the point being is in their times like "],["874.639","our times like future times we will be "],["877.36","afraid "],["878.959","the bible says "],["880.56","to um "],["882.32","in philippians it says be anxious for "],["884.959","nothing "],["887.519","be anxious for nothing how can we not be "],["890.88","anxious for something "],["892.72","we care a lot about our kids "],["895.6","we care a lot about our family our jobs "],["899.6","the people whom we serve this church "],["903.279","i'm not saying be anxious to the point "],["905.12","of petrification "],["907.92","that is frozen solid "],["911.199","but be concerned "],["913.36","but bring it to christ "],["915.44","first "],["917.36","how often we forget "],["920.32","and we try to resolve the issues "],["922.32","ourselves first "],["926.56","but we forget to bring it to christ "],["929.68","first "],["931.12","then start dealing the problem because "],["933.36","he will make a way "],["937.12","he will find us a way of escape like he "],["940.72","did me with that terrible boss "],["944.32","he will find you "],["945.92","a way of escape "],["948.24","and it's amazing "],["949.92","when these things happen "],["951.68","we often look at them in terms of "],["955.759","why me "],["957.6","lord why did you pick me why did you "],["960","save me "],["962.56","why in this rocking boat "],["965.6","why are we "],["967.279","suddenly "],["968.56","calm "],["970.639","because christ goes before us "],["977.839","so why did the disciples "],["979.92","not recognize jesus on that fateful "],["982.48","night "],["984.32","it's simple "],["985.759","they were not looking for him "],["989.44","and that's the point that i wanted to "],["991.04","make because they weren't looking for "],["993.04","him we often aren't looking for him "],["997.68","but had they been "],["999.839","looking for jesus even on the shoreline "],["1003.279","but no they were concerned with their "],["1005.36","own problems and understandably so "],["1009.44","we are trained to be concerned with our "],["1011.6","own problems first "],["1014.32","but "],["1015.36","we can "],["1016.8","and we need to practice "],["1018.72","looking to jesus first "],["1023.44","so that "],["1025.12","scene continues with jesus walking on "],["1028","water don't be afraid "],["1032.16","good old peter "],["1033.76","we all love simon peter "],["1037.6","he says lord if it's you "],["1040.559","tell me to come out to you on the water "],["1044.88","those of you in awana "],["1046.959","or even in children's ministry realize "],["1049.76","that peter "],["1051.039","is the impetuous sparky "],["1053.84","that isn't going to do what you're told "],["1056.64","he's got a world on his own and he's "],["1060","going to jump right out "],["1061.84","and he's going to do whatever he wants "],["1064.08","to first i'm sure simon peter was a "],["1066.96","handful to his parents "],["1069.44","and they didn't have ritalin back in "],["1070.88","those days "],["1074","but that's what gives this whole story "],["1076.559","character "],["1078.32","that's what peter had "],["1080.4","he had guts he had faith he had ambition "],["1085.039","not to climb a pillar but to serve to be "],["1088.32","a part of christ's ministry "],["1091.84","he really wanted to jump in literally "],["1098.799","so the lord says "],["1100.64","come "],["1102.4","now that word come in this "],["1105.2","instance "],["1106.88","is as if a master "],["1109.2","was speaking to an underling not "],["1111.679","necessarily a slave not necessarily a "],["1113.919","dog but something in between and it's "],["1116.24","kind of a command a friendly command "],["1118.72","it's come "],["1120.72","here if i don't no it's not that "],["1123.76","but he said come in a "],["1126.24","directive way "],["1130.4","then peter got out of the boat "],["1132.96","walked on water "],["1134.559","and came toward jesus it says it so "],["1136.64","emphatically "],["1138.48","there should be a lot more drama in this "],["1142.799","but "],["1146.16","peter is on the water "],["1149.76","and he's "],["1151.039","got his eyes fixed on jesus "],["1153.84","and he's coming to jesus "],["1156.96","but then "],["1158.32","as you know "],["1159.84","it was a rocky and stormy night "],["1162.559","and the wind was howling "],["1165.039","there was no trees blocking it "],["1168","probably a wave smacked into his face "],["1172.08","and he's looking around "],["1173.919","in his environment and he doesn't "],["1176.08","realize he's taken his eyes off of jesus "],["1182.96","and he starts to sink "],["1187.28","we all have been there "],["1191.039","we all have been there when we take our "],["1194.32","eyes off of jesus "],["1197.039","and it's frightening "],["1198.96","because then this world starts to "],["1200.88","envelop us "],["1202.799","and we start to sink "],["1205.28","and so peter is there realizing that the "],["1208.16","water is coming up and quite rapidly "],["1212.16","it's now coming up over his head and he "],["1214.72","says those in mortal words lord "],["1217.28","save me "],["1219.039","and he reaches out his hand "],["1221.44","just before he goes under "],["1224.96","and jesus grabs his hand "],["1227.44","and pulls him back up "],["1230","but that's not the point "],["1233.039","it's not only that jesus can save us "],["1235.76","it's us raising our hand "],["1238.88","it's us raising our hand to the lord "],["1241.28","we're raising our hand "],["1243.36","asking for forgiveness asking for help "],["1247.679","lord save us "],["1251.6","keith "],["1253.12","you said your 25 years

attention waiting for "],["1289.919","someone to help us no we've got to raise "],["1292.96","our hand and they will help push our "],["1294.72","hand up further "],["1296.24","so that the lord can grab it and pull us "],["1298.72","up "],["1300.88","picture that in your life "],["1303.44","we all have been there "],["1306.24","whether it's a substance issue whether "],["1308.08","it's a family issue whether it's an "],["1310.24","adolescent child gone rogue "],["1313.12","whether it's just a faith issue we don't "],["1315.679","understand what god wants us to do "],["1319.36","put your hand up "],["1321.52","put your hand up "],["1323.12","he wants to take your hand whether "],["1325.679","you're a follower of christ or not "],["1329.12","i can give you a lot of stories in my "],["1330.88","life where i had to put my hand up "],["1332.559","repeatedly "],["1334.24","not just once many times "],["1338.24","but jesus is always there to get that "],["1342.24","hand "],["1344.48","simon peter learned it the hard way "],["1347.36","he put his hand up it was grabbed and "],["1350.08","they went back to the boat "],["1352.96","they sat down in the boat and the waves "],["1355.6","calmed down "],["1358.559","that's another miracle "],["1361.44","and they're all looking at each other "],["1363.28","good grief he fed five thousand he "],["1365.36","walked on the water the waves stopped "],["1368.159","who is this man "],["1371.28","it's spectacular the way these disciples "],["1373.76","think "],["1375.6","and what's more "],["1377.679","is jesus looks at peter "],["1380.48","and he says you of little faith "],["1383.6","it wasn't a kindly remark "],["1387.36","it was a rebuke "],["1389.52","it was "],["1390.559","peter "],["1392.48","why have you so little faith "],["1397.12","peter of course couldn't say anything "],["1400.48","but he had done the impossible through "],["1403.12","christ "],["1405.039","we all have done "],["1406.88","the impossible through christ "],["1409.76","but only through christ "],["1412.24","we see kids come to the lord "],["1415.2","what an honor it is to be there "],["1418.32","and they come to christ "],["1420.559","they come to know him as their savior "],["1424.08","we've been with adults "],["1426.159","who are struggling "],["1428.32","and they get out of that struggle "],["1431.44","and they're blessed by christ "],["1434.24","because they put their hand up also "],["1437.36","it's wonder to be a part of that simon "],["1440.159","peter is sitting there listening to "],["1442.32","jesus as he is saying why have you so "],["1445.44","little faith "],["1448.159","that alone would change simon peter that "],["1451.44","alone would change just about all of us "],["1458.72","and they said truly you are the son of "],["1460.559","god "],["1463.44","and "],["1464.48","they got lower "],["1466.08","and they started to pray "],["1468","and they worshiped jesus "],["1470.32","as the son of god "],["1472.88","what does it take for us to recognize "],["1476","the son of god "],["1477.44","in our life and in our work "],["1480.72","i praise god that he's got

little bit more "],["243.84","background about the history "],["246.08","the spanish came to the philippines in "],["247.92","1521 through ferdinand magellan and so "],["251.439","it was under spanish rule for over 300 "],["254.239","years until 1899 "],["256.479","and then the philippines became a u.s "],["258.239","territory in 1899 and it was also a big "],["261.84","battleground during world war ii and if "],["264.639","you remember "],["265.759","general douglas macarthur he said i "],["267.44","shall return "],["268.8","so that we fought a war with the "],["271.12","filipino people to try to free them from "],["273.84","the japanese during the time of world "],["275.6","war ii "],["276.639","it became an independent country on july "],["279.04","4 1946 "],["283.36","my great-grandfather also was a u.s "],["285.04","serviceman in the philippines right "],["287.28","around 1902 about 120 years ago "],["290.24","so the philippines had two has two "],["291.919","national languages filipino or called "],["294.84","tagalog and english "],["297.6","so "],["298.88","also most filipinos can communicate "],["301.68","in "],["302.4","basic english and if you've spoken to a "],["304.4","lot of filipino people they actually "],["306.08","they can speak pretty decent english so "],["308.08","it's the second most populous uh country "],["311.28","in the world that where english is "],["312.96","spoken widely in their nation the united "],["315.919","states being the first "],["317.6","also there are many different local and "],["319.28","tribal languages and dialects in the "],["321.039","philippines we have about 120 different "],["323.36","languages so in one in that way it's "],["325.44","kind of like india uh but there's "],["327.84","probably four or five that are mainly "],["330","spoken "],["330.96","throughout the philippines uh where "],["333.199","people can communicate "],["334.88","with that and like i said the laws are "],["336.96","written in english the most of the "],["338.88","driving the signs on the road and things "],["341.52","like that are all in english as well and "],["344","their medium of instruction is mainly in "],["345.759","english in the schools "],["347.52","so that's that's very nice as well "],["350.72","so back in uh 2000 "],["353.28","mid-2000s or so "],["355.199","uh teresa we were just discussing this "],["357.52","we were living in birmingham i was going "],["359.12","to seminary in birmingham alabama "],["361.36","and she was just saying like it's really "],["363.28","hard in the philippines because a lot of "],["365.12","pastors are not trained properly on how "],["367.44","to interpret the bible "],["369.36","and if they cannot interpret the bible "],["370.96","correctly much more with the "],["373.28","congregations you know so "],["375.52","and that really put it on my heart "],["377.759","i guess during that time it's like wow "],["380","you know we really need to be "],["382.96","training pastors and and "],["385.28","i'm really looking forward to that "],["386.88","opportunity so after taking some other "],["388.88","short-term mission trips "],["390.639","you know we decided to move back as a "],["393.039","family in 2010 because when i was there "],["395.44","in 2002 i was like in the right place at "],["398","the wrong time and i just i just wasn't "],["400.88","ready i was living there for eight "],["402.08","months as a single missionary and it "],["404.479","just was not i didn't really "],["406.88","really enjoy being there that much i "],["409.039","guess i got homesick you know miss "],["410.56","alabama home cooking and things like "],["412.4","that "],["413.199","but now being over there it's like you "],["415.36","know it doesn't really matter so much so "],["417.199","it's like over time god was preparing my "],["419.28","heart and my wife's heart to return back "],["422.08","to the philippines to train pastors and "],["424.16","that is our primary ministry in training "],["426.8","pastors "],["428.4","so what we have a class in "],["430.479","a provincial class it's three hours for "],["433.039","our city so we have a car or a "],["435.759","transportation and we drive early in the "],["438.319","morning and we get there at nine o'clock "],["440.8","9 30 "],["442","and then this pastor albert here "],["444.8","he is the one he's two "],["447.44","i guess two people on my left there he's "],["449.36","the far left pastor "],["451.12","back in 2016 i met him at a pastor's "],["453.36","conference and he just expressed the "],["455.759","desires like we really want you to come "],["459.759","and teach and train pastors in our "],["462.319","location i have a house that you could "],["464.4","use and it's right on the side of the "],["466.4","road it's in a really good location so "],["468.96","right now we have 10 or 15 students and "],["472.479","before it was a little bit more and we "],["474.96","we meet in his house there "],["477.28","and we come together and have we're "],["479.919","teaching like bible interpretation "],["481.44","classes in the morning in theology in "],["483.039","the afternoon to pastors and church "],["484.72","leaders in "],["486.319","this location and it's called a bhatan "],["488.72","bugas the pastor there right next to me "],["491.599","on my left side or left side of the "],["493.759","picture there is pastor paul he "],["496.16","graduated from our training in 2013 and "],["499.52","he has been a tremendous help "],["502.16","in um "],["504","and teaching the classes because he can "],["505.599","speak the local dialect better than i "],["507.44","can so he's been really helpful and he "],["510.639","knows these people he's from not too far "],["512.64","from the place "],["513.839","so he's he teaches in afternoons and i "],["516","teach in the morning so we kind of team "],["517.76","teach these

get in finally we were able to "],["693.839","go into the philippines in july of 2020 "],["696.8","but it was no easy task "],["700","and you know we had a "],["701.6","hotel mandatory quarantine "],["704.399","where basically they lock you into your "],["705.92","rooms you can't leave "],["707.519","and we had two coveted tests and a "],["710.24","14-day mandatory quarantine uh in our "],["713.44","home city so when we get to our city of "],["715.839","baguio "],["717.36","you know the policemen escort us to the "],["719.839","testing facility and then the government "],["722.079","officials "],["723.68","knock knock on your door during your "],["725.12","14-day quarantine to make sure that "],["726.88","you're there and that you're not "],["728.56","violating quarantine procedures and that "],["731.36","by that time we already had two negative "],["732.88","tests but we still had to maintain a 14 "],["735.2","day quarantine so they were very strict "],["738.16","and the bad thing about it was during "],["739.92","this time we couldn't go to the mountain "],["741.6","province because it was like every state "],["744.8","or province is kind of like many states "],["747.2","here in the states locked down like you "],["749.519","can't just go "],["751.12","the borders were shut down so unless "],["753.68","you're from that location you just can't "],["755.44","go in "],["756.959","and we could not leave the city we were "],["758.8","like trapped there for a year "],["760.8","thankfully we were back in our philip in "],["762.48","the philippines we could do ministry "],["763.839","within the city limited but going into "],["767.36","places and traveling where our pastors "],["769.519","are it was very challenging so back in "],["772.72","july of 2021 after a year of us being "],["775.76","there thankfully we were finally able to "],["778.48","go into the city or to this province "],["780.8","here from our city and travel "],["783.76","and the fellowship was just wonderful "],["785.519","after i haven't seen these guys in two "],["787.12","years "],["788.079","and it was just a blessing "],["790.32","because even though "],["792.399","uh we had an online class many of these "],["794.72","guys could not join because their "],["796.32","internet they're in a real rural "],["798.079","location their cell phone signal is very "],["800.399","weak and they don't have like a "],["801.92","high-speed internet or wi-fi "],["804.16","and "],["806.079","really the only way to reach them is "],["807.68","through face-to-face "],["809.6","but so it's a blessing we've been in "],["811.519","this place now "],["812.959","teaching regularly every month for about "],["814.959","a year now and it's been a blessing to "],["817.36","to have fellowship with these pastors "],["819.68","over the past year or so "],["823.04","so another one of our classes and is in "],["825.68","baguio where we have "],["827.519","before we were meeting in our homes but "],["829.92","due to covid we started meeting online "],["833.12","virtually so we started an online class "],["836.24","it's not in our slideshow here but we've "],["838.399","been doing online classes now for almost "],["840.56","two years "],["841.76","and it has been a blessing we're very "],["843.839","thankful to have the online access "],["845.839","because even uh there's people we have "],["848.32","one guy join us from sri lanka "],["850.72","and we also have people that filipinos "],["853.199","that join us from australia and hong "],["855.44","kong and others people in "],["858","manila area that join our classes "],["860.079","actually you guys could join as well we "],["861.76","have a class "],["863.279","starting in september online "],["865.839","uh eight o'clock in the morning maryland "],["868.72","time i know it's weird it's like why "],["870.72","would you do a class at eight o'clock in "],["872.16","the morning well because in the "],["873.36","philippines it's eight o'clock in the "],["874.48","evening so we kind of have to cater to "],["876.639","our most of the people that attend our "],["878.16","class so we have an online class and "],["879.92","we'll be going through verse by verse to "],["881.36","the book of galatians so it's a lot of "],["883.519","fun we have uh if you want to join our "],["886.16","class or if you know anybody that would "],["887.44","benefit we is for free it's a zoom and "],["890.56","all you have to do is click on the link "],["892.079","and then we're there "],["893.68","so back in 2020 "],["896.24","uh what happened was because of the "],["897.839","coveted restrictions just like in most "],["900.16","places of the world "],["901.68","um "],["902.56","we the church that we were attending "],["904.399","before "],["905.6","they were limited of space "],["907.519","we were meeting in a small little house "],["909.199","church about five families "],["911.6","and i wasn't the pastor but we were good "],["913.76","friends with the pastor the pastor was "],["915.44","one of our pastoral students "],["918.72","we could not "],["920.16","uh "],["921.04","we our space was limited the church "],["922.8","could only have 10 people in it "],["925.04","that's very limited how many you saw how "],["927.279","big my family is we're five "],["929.279","so the problem is like what do we do "],["932","you know we we're back here we are back "],["934.399","in the philippines and "],["936.56","we talked about it with a pastor we're "],["938.16","like you know what this is not the good "],["940","a good timing for us to be going to this "],["941.6","church "],["942.56","so with prayer talking to our other "],["945.92","our previous pastor and talking to the "],["948.16","new pastor who is also in our church uh "],["951.279","excuse me he was who studied under our "],["953.12","theological training we decided to join "],["955.199","another church and the space was not an "],["957.12","issue that had a bigger uh facility "],["960.16","and it was a it was a blessing "],["962.24","so covet actually really like turned "],["965.519","into a blessing because we the pastor "],["969.44","needed "],["970.88","us in our church to train "],["973.44","and to train their people in theology "],["975.68","and to set up different ministries so we "],["978.16","have really worked hand in hand with our "],["979.92","pastor pastor jason is the name of our "],["982","new church or he's a pastor of the new "],["984.24","church "],["985.279","and uh we started a bible interpretation "],["988.399","class to train the leaders because our "],["990.48","church is really big in the ministry but "],["992.72","it lacked some of the theological "],["994.16","training that needed they're really "],["995.759","excited about it but yet that's what we "],["997.839","did so we went through different uh "],["1000.399","bible interpretation classes and "],["1002.639","theology classes every sunday afternoon "],["1005.519","and we had this from like october 2020 "],["1008.32","and we just finished this class in may "],["1009.92","of 2022 just two months before i came "],["1012.8","here that was a blessing and we've "],["1015.279","really enjoyed this class and and going "],["1018.399","through the different uh how to "],["1020","interpret the scriptures the the nice "],["1022.399","thing about face face-to-face is we can "],["1024","have more questions more interaction "],["1026.24","and i love the online access to be able "],["1028.319","to reach different people but it does "],["1030.959","create a hindrance only because you "],["1032.799","don't have the face-to-face interactions "],["1035.28","and thankfully uh "],["1037.52","we have it with our class here "],["1039.76","this more interactions with our class "],["1045.28","so what we started in march of 2022 and "],["1048.799","going back to the covert thing again "],["1051.36","well like i said the government in the "],["1053.36","philippines has been very very strict "],["1056.96","with youth and senior citizens "],["1060.08","and it's very discriminatory and "],["1062.799","like "],["1063.76","right when coveted started "],["1065.76","basically if you're over the age of 60 "],["1067.919","you are not allowed to go out of your "],["1069.44","house unless for essential purposes "],["1072.48","and if you're under the age of 20 you "],["1074.32","are not allowed out of your house "],["1076.24","and it was very very difficult for "],["1078.32","senior citizens and the young generation "],["1081.039","someone say why the young people because "],["1082.799","everybody knows that young people do "],["1084.32","better with kova than the adults i mean "],["1086.32","adults especially the elderly when the "],["1088.88","philippines the way it's set up is "],["1091.12","most elderly people live at home with "],["1093.84","their "],["1094.64","their adult children "],["1096.64","and you got multiple generations living "],["1098.96","in the house "],["1100","so you got like kids who are like seven "],["1102.88","eight ten years old living with the "],["1104.64","parents of course and then you got their "],["1106.799","parents "],["1107.76","living with "],["1109.12","the parents so you got senior citizens "],["1111.28","living with i think they were worried "],["1112.96","about kids going out catching covid and "],["1115.52","bringing it into the house and infecting "],["1118.16","their senior citizen grandparents "],["1120.799","so that's the reason that we had it but "],["1123.28","it was very strict when we first got "],["1125.36","there you had to have a grocery pass if "],["1127.919","you wanted to go to the grocery store "],["1129.84","and you could only go out twice a week "],["1131.919","to the go your groceries so me and "],["1133.6","teresa's day was wednesday and "],["1136.4","saturday "],["1138","and it was only one person for family "],["1140.559","so you couldn't bring your kids "],["1142.799","we couldn't go together "],["1144.4","and it was only theresa she would "],["1146.08","normally go grocery shopping "],["1148.08","and it was only there i guess they were "],["1150","trying to prevent everybody going "],["1151.6","grocery shopping at one time "],["1153.44","but thankfully after two months of "],["1156.08","being there they removed that "],["1157.44","restriction and we could go grocery "],["1158.72","shopping anytime we wanted to but it was "],["1160.799","very strict with the kids so i remember "],["1163.039","easter sunday "],["1164.64","last year 2021 "],["1166.88","april of 2021 policemen the mayor had "],["1170.4","policemen checking cars to make sure "],["1172.559","children were not in the vehicle and if "],["1174.4","you did "],["1175.44","i mean they wouldn't get arrested or "],["1176.88","anything but they would warn you what is "],["1178.64","your child doing you know that they're "],["1180.799","not supposed to be out and this was on "],["1182.64","easter sunday so i mean that's it's just "],["1185.2","for us as americans that's really "],["1186.799","unusual you know uh but thankfully "],["1190.72","after two years "],["1192.4","all those restrictions went away "],["1194.559","and uh "],["1196.24","and we were able to have youth "],["1197.52","fellowship again in our church so teresa "],["1200.16","was working with the pastors pastor "],["1202.159","jason our pastor and and the pastor's "],["1204.64","wife and restarting the youth fellowship "],["1206.88","after two years of not having a youth "],["1208.88","fellowship face to face "],["1210.64","so this is what we've been doing in the "],["1212.4","past since march of 2022 "],["1214.72","and coveted really hit hard with the "],["1217.44","youth these restrictions "],["1219.84","it's because "],["1220.88","early on in the pandemic in up into "],["1223.12","december of 2020 we actually had more "],["1225.679","suicides in our city than actual covet "],["1228.4","deaths "],["1229.28","so it was very devastating and now "],["1232.48","starting in two weeks from now our kids "],["1234.88","will be going back to face-to-face "],["1236.48","classes of after two years "],["1238.64","of not having face-to-face classes so "],["1242.08","every country is different in every "],["1243.44","country the philippines is one of the "],["1244.88","most strictest countries in the world "],["1246.64","when it comes to the coveted lockdowns "],["1249.76","and granted i'm not trying to advocate "],["1252.159","i'm not saying positive or negative but "],["1254.799","it was really hard as well because the "],["1256.64","medical professionals "],["1258.4","you know if you have even a few severe "],["1260.48","cases where they had to go into oxygen "],["1262.96","those people don't leave the hospital "],["1264.24","right away they stayed there for a month "],["1266.08","or two and it clogged up the hospitals "],["1269.039","the philippines doesn't have enough "],["1270.32","nurses they don't have enough doctors "],["1272.24","they don't have enough medical "],["1273.36","professionals so it was really a very "],["1275.36","difficult situation and covid was really "],["1278","devastating "],["1279.6","physically "],["1280.88","economically we don't have stimulus like "],["1283.28","we have in the states they don't have "],["1284.96","unemployment so literally "],["1287.36","millions of filipinos lost their jobs "],["1289.6","and then we have also "],["1291.28","uh you know people were mentally you "],["1293.28","know devastated so it was just like "],["1295.6","nothing good the two years have been "],["1297.76","devastating for the country that's why "],["1300","we when we were able to do youth "],["1301.52","fellowships again we were on top of it "],["1304","and we had young people ministries we "],["1305.919","teresa designs the lessons so we have "],["1308.48","this twice a month "],["1310.48","uh every normally sunday afternoon and "],["1313.12","actually something that we're going to "],["1314.559","start during school we're going to start "],["1317.2","having every friday evenings like a just "],["1320","a fellowship time a minute bible study "],["1322.4","fellowship time and teresa really wanted "],["1325.44","to make sure especially with our kids "],["1326.799","being teenagers now "],["1328.32","that you know it's the church should be "],["1330.32","the hangout place of the kids you know "],["1332.32","it's not to be the world it's not to be "],["1334.08","this let's get the kids really busy and "],["1336.64","doing godly stuff and making godly "],["1339.36","friends and things like that so our "],["1341.36","church is going to be the official "],["1342.48","hangout spot for all the kids so we're "],["1344.559","hoping we're looking forward to that "],["1345.679","that'll start next month "],["1348","also after three years of not having uh "],["1350.96","our church in the philippines we didn't "],["1352.4","have a youth camp for three years but "],["1356.24","we were finally able to have a youth "],["1357.76","camp back in "],["1359.52","may of 2022 "],["1361.52","early june 2022 and it was on the beach "],["1365.679","so we were able to have a youth camp "],["1367.28","again "],["1368.559","and if you ever been to the beach when "],["1370.08","it's really hot "],["1371.52","it's just humid humid and hot in the "],["1373.76","philippines is the same way the boys "],["1376.4","spent the night on intense on the beach "],["1379.6","and battling the heat and humidity the "],["1381.6","girls they were in these fan rooms "],["1383.84","they're like little wooden huts with "],["1385.52","electric fans and the staff we got nice "],["1388.799","comfortable air conditioned rooms "],["1391.12","so i don't know everybody was "],["1392.48","complaining about the heat at night but "],["1394.08","for me it was like no big deal "],["1396.159","it was a lot of fun but the kids did "],["1398.08","really good and we had a really great "],["1399.919","youth camp we had about "],["1403.12","60 kids "],["1404.799","teenagers and about 18 staff so we were "],["1408","able to offer it cheap and due to some "],["1411.039","fundraising that we had and "],["1413.44","i think each camper paid 22 "],["1417.2","wait 18 dollars per person "],["1419.919","and if you came from a far away province "],["1422.559","if we we even made it where it was only "],["1424.559","like 10 "],["1425.6","per person that's lodging in a beach "],["1427.76","resort that's food and that's "],["1429.6","transportation "],["1430.96","all for that and that's for them that "],["1432.559","was a little bit of money and they also "],["1433.919","did fundraisers they did car washes and "],["1436.72","selling things so to make it as well "],["1438.88","where it could be very inexpensive for "],["1440.72","them so they had like two months of "],["1442","fundraisers and staff and staff kids "],["1444.799","went for free so we were able to through "],["1447.12","all the ministry fundraising we were "],["1448.96","able to do that we're really thankful "],["1450.4","for that we didn't want economics or you "],["1452.96","know "],["1453.679","finances to be an issue with kids coming "],["1455.84","to camp "],["1457.279","so it was a blessing "],["1459.279","also our latest bible

"],["32.16","and we're going to look at a fascinating "],["34.14","text of scripture all of them are in "],["36.3","their own right but this one I think is "],["38.28","particularly relevant in light of what "],["40.86","is taking place "],["42.6","in our world today "],["46.559","first Thessalonians chapter 4 "],["49.68","and I want to begin by speaking to the "],["52.32","author of this text not Paul but rather "],["54.719","the Lord himself shall we pray "],["61.26","Lord "],["62.94","in you alone we find Our Hope Lord Jesus "],["65.88","you have made a way for us "],["68.52","we confess we are your bond servants and "],["71.22","typically Masters are not in the habit "],["73.38","of telling their slaves what their plans "],["76.08","are "],["77.4","and yet you love us so much you clue us "],["80.52","into what your future plans are "],["82.86","and we can know in advance "],["85.619","what's going to take place in our world "],["88.56","and so Lord Jesus we do need hope we "],["91.079","need comfort we need encouragement we "],["93.659","need a larger perspective and so we pray "],["96","that your spirit "],["97.439","would have free reign in each of our "],["99.24","hearts that you would accomplish in each "],["101.34","of our lives whatever it is you want to "],["103.079","do "],["104.579","and Lord if there be one or two here "],["106.259","this morning who have yet to taste and "],["108.299","see that you are good they have yet to "],["110.22","put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ "],["112.079","I pray before they leave they would "],["114.72","leave transformed new creatures in "],["116.759","Christ by virtue of trusting Jesus for "],["119.52","salvation "],["121.02","and so Lord may your spirit do what he "],["123.119","wants to do we will listen "],["125.52","we pray it in your name amen "],["128.58","amen "],["132.239","a dark cloud lingered over the room I "],["134.819","remember it well I was a young guy it "],["136.92","was a sad occasion "],["138.9","the men wore black suits the women wore "],["141.54","black dresses with black veils over "],["143.94","their faces people were weeping and "],["146.76","wailing uncontrollably one woman was so "],["149.94","overcome with grief "],["151.8","she began to faint "],["154.26","and as people entered that particular "],["156.9","room the funeral home "],["159","they registered their attendance in a "],["160.98","little book and then they went over by "],["162.599","the body "],["163.98","and paid their respects many of them "],["165.9","kneeled down at the little kneeler right "],["168.3","in front of the casket and they prayed "],["171.18","for the soul of the deceased "],["175.92","did all of this grief flow from a sense "],["178.56","of personal loss "],["181.62","I believe it did "],["183.36","most all of us I would assume if you've "],["185.64","lost a loved one you feel that loss it "],["188.34","actually is a loss right and God gave us "],["192","the capacity to grieve and I think it's "],["193.8","healthy to grieve there's two extremes "],["195.42","on either side we don't want to go there "],["198","but in the middle we should process the "],["201.12","loss and of course process it with God "],["203.879","in the middle of the situation "],["207.239","but I believe as I think back on that "],["209.519","occasion most of the grief could be "],["211.379","attributed "],["212.94","to an underlying sense "],["216.18","of hopelessness "],["219.18","hopelessness because the future of the "],["221.58","deceased was uncertain "],["224.519","and perhaps you've been overcome at some "],["226.68","point in your life with a sense of "],["228.72","hopelessness as you lost the loved one "],["230.7","and just weren't sure where they were "],["232.56","headed or what their destination was "],["235.86","and it's a very sad experience gloomy "],["240.84","well the young church at thessalonica "],["242.7","was beginning to experience a sense of "],["245.58","hopelessness apparently there were a "],["247.2","number in their Fellowship who had died "],["250.379","and we're not sure if it was due to "],["252.06","persecution or natural causes or a "],["254.159","combination thereof but the bottom line "],["256.56","is the Thessalonians did not know the "],["259.44","fate of these who had died "],["262.139","in Christ "],["264.54","they thought the future was uncertain "],["266.16","for them they wondered will only the "],["268.62","living Saints be caught up to meet Jesus "],["271.38","in the clouds "],["273.06","will the dead in Christ miss out "],["276","on the rapture "],["277.5","these are the questions they had when "],["279.54","Jesus returns while our departed loved "],["281.52","ones in Christ remain "],["283.74","in the grave "],["286.199","while receiving word that the "],["288.54","Thessalonians were beginning to despair "],["290.88","the Apostle Paul sat down and wrote to "],["293.639","instruct them and to comfort them he "],["296.34","wrote first Thessalonians 2 "],["297.72","Thessalonians thank God we have those "],["299.52","today "],["300.66","and very simply his Truth at least in "],["303.12","this portion of scripture is this and "],["305.46","that is the rapture is certain for all "],["309.74","Believers in Christ "],["312.3","the Rapture is certain for all whether "],["314.28","dead or living "],["316.38","the Rapture is certain for all believers "],["319.32","in Christ "],["321.3","now I want you to follow as we go "],["322.919","through the text here because I'm going "],["324.24","to ask a question of the text and that "],["327","question is simply this what specific "],["329.699","assurances do we have that in fact the "],["333","Rapture is certain for all believers in "],["336","Christ all right so you're following me "],["338.16","this is where we're headed if you have a "],["339.78","pen or pencil you may want to write some "],["341.58","things down here is the first assurance "],["343.86","and that is the rapture is assured "],["346.199","because of the Lord's Resurrection "],["349.62","the Rapture is assured because of the "],["352.44","Lord's Resurrection you'll see it if you "],["354.6","look with me in the text we're in first "],["356.16","Thessalonians chapter 4 picking up at "],["359.819","verse 13. "],["361.5","it says "],["362.759","but we do not want you to be uninformed "],["365.16","Brethren about those who are asleep "],["368.22","so that you will not grieve as do the "],["370.68","rest who have no hope and then he "],["373.02","elaborates "],["374.28","Paul says for if we believe that Jesus "],["377.46","died and rose again "],["379.5","even so God will bring with him those "],["382.38","who have fallen asleep "],["384.12","in Jesus so the first question I have "],["386.58","here is who are those who are asleep "],["390.3","that is beside perhaps a segment of all "],["392.759","my audiences where I preach there's "],["394.56","always a segment who have fallen asleep "],["396.36","it's a public service I provide for "],["398.34","those who are sleep deprived please "],["400.56","don't snore if that describes you but of "],["402.72","course you're probably not hearing me "],["404.28","right now I hope your dream is a good "],["405.96","one "],["406.919","but nevertheless this phrase those who "],["409.38","are asleep refers to believers who have "],["411.78","died in Christ in other words sleep is a "],["414.599","metaphor for death and I think it's a "],["416.759","very sweet metaphor "],["419.58","John says in John 11 11 and this is the "],["423.18","words of Jesus recorded here "],["425.22","our friend Lazarus "],["427.259","has fallen asleep now we know he died "],["429.479","right but I go that I may awaken him out "],["432.84","of sleep and so for the Christian sleep "],["435.36","and death are both "],["438.12","temporary "],["439.8","think of the word "],["441.539","Cemetery coimitarian in the Greek what "],["445.38","does that word mean it means a sleeping "],["449.099","place "],["452.22","death is not the last part of the story "],["454.319","for those who know Christ and so why "],["456.96","does Paul not want them to be uninformed "],["460.86","the text answers that question it says "],["463.44","verse 13 that you may not grieve now as "],["467.099","I mentioned already we should grieve our "],["469.56","personal loss hear the word it actually "],["471.479","is a loss acknowledge that "],["473.58","you've lost a dear loved one who had a "],["475.68","big impact in your life perhaps "],["476.94","acknowledge that process that with the "],["479.819","Lord "],["481.199","so yes grieve but we should not grieve "],["484.139","over the Eternal gain "],["487.08","of a deceased believer because quite "],["489.06","frankly you're deceased Aunt Uncle "],["491.819","cousin whoever who knew the lord they're "],["494.34","doing better than you "],["495.9","we're still stuck down here paying taxes "],["498.72","and a lot worse I won't get into it I "],["500.759","won't mention the I word inflation or "],["502.44","any of those things "],["503.759","and that's way worse than that it's more "],["505.86","than financial but the point is they are "],["508.08","in the presence of Jesus Christ the one "],["510.78","who we claim we love more than anybody "],["512.58","else the one who we know loves us with "],["516","an unlimited infinite look imagine being "],["518.519","in his presence "],["520.2","so that's far better that's a graduation "],["522.18","right "],["523.08","so we don't want to grieve over that "],["524.58","part of it he says that you may not "],["526.62","grieve how as those who have no hope do "],["530.76","not grieve as the rest who have no hope "],["532.8","that's unbelievers who have no hope of "],["535.019","Resurrection unto eternal life only unto "],["539.04","Eternal death how long does eternity "],["540.959","last "],["542.04","that's Eternal separation from God I "],["544.92","wouldn't wish that on anybody "],["548.04","and if you have not

eternity and it could be a "],["559.26","heartbeat or something else "],["562.14","and then it's irrevocable "],["565.019","so what does it mean to be eternally "],["566.88","separated from God well God is the only "],["568.68","source of light "],["570.66","love right "],["572.82","so think about it "],["575.399","that's Eternal Darkness it's the "],["578.1","opposite of love "],["580.2","uh yeah I had years ago and I still "],["582.06","can't believe it "],["583.44","one guy told me one time he says I want "],["585.06","to go to hell I thought it was a bad "],["586.98","joke I said say

"],["1143.539","raptured right up they won't get a "],["1145.7","chance to die if it's the day of the "],["1147.02","Rapture right however we all shall be "],["1149.299","changed

"],["1157.82","well shall not look at the word there "],["1159.559","verse 15 shall not precede those who "],["1162.74","have fallen asleep that means to go "],["1165.14","first or to gain an

"],["1193.34","you see it there for the Lord himself "],["1195.02","will descend from heaven with a shout "],["1197.84","literally a shout of command and this "],["1200.48","may be Christ shout of

that's in the "],["1323.72","middle of the seven year period and "],["1324.919","that's when the church is taken up so "],["1326.36","they experience Wrath for the first half "],["1329.059","people

Matthew 24 which if you look "],["1353","very carefully that is addressing the "],["1356.9","nation of Israel the church is not even "],["1358.4","on the radar there if you look at the "],["1360.14","verse without the context you might "],["1361.64","think it's the Rapture but it's not "],["1364.039","point being whatever your view he's "],["1368","coming back the one view that I

"],["1609.08","actually going to take us to heaven for "],["1610.46","the seven years "],["1612.14","you see if it's going to be the U-turn "],["1614.059","thing at the end where we go up high "],["1615.62","Jesus and we come back down that means "],["1617.659","we're not going to be in heaven for "],["1618.62","seven years what do we do at John 14.

"],["1645.799","please just to give the guy a break but "],["1648.26","we'd be happy to talk to you if you "],["1650.419","notice verse 17 "],["1652.1","it's very interesting here because he "],["1654.679","says then we who are alive and remain "],["1658.52","will be caught up together with them in "],["1660.74","the clouds to meet the Lord in the air "],["1662.899","and so we shall always be with the Lord "],["1665.899","now what's interesting here is we've "],["1668.36","already seen that the Rapture is assured "],["1671.24","because of the Lord's Resurrection The "],["1673.34","Rapture is assured because of the Lord's "],["1676.399","Revelation and now we're going to see "],["1678.38","that the Rapture is assured because of "],["1681.32","the Lord's return you

all kinds of verses "],["1705.74","on that and that's the point here it's "],["1708.679","it's going to happen and it's assured "],["1710.6","because he will actually come back in "],["1713.24","person there's no doubt about it it says "],["1715.279","there in verse 17 then we who are alive "],["1717.98","and remain shall be caught up literally "],["1720.44","to catch away

"],["1883.76","tired I don't want to open these seals "],["1885.919","then no judgment "],["1887.84","so whose wrath Is It Anyway "],["1890.299","it's the Lord's right and he's saying "],["1893.059","that Jesus Rescues us from the Wrath to "],["1895.7","come that's why I say that trumpet "],["1897.76","again cheap sound effects I'm sorry but "],["1901.1","that trumpet is a rescue

the second coming when Christ "],["1924.019","properly comes back with the church "],["1926.179","after the seven years that's when he "],["1928.7","physically puts his sandals right on the "],["1930.799","Mount of Olives one verse of many if you "],["1933.26","want it Zechariah 14 4. and in that day "],["1937.64","his feet will stand on a Mount of Olives "],["1940.399","and again there won't be that U-turn "],["1942.5","based on a Roman custom there's a custom "],["1944.48","which says that when a dignitary "],["1946.7","approaches the city the mayor and all "],["1949.039","the big shots go out there and meet him "],["1950.419","out in the country and say okay nice to "],["1952.399","see you come on down we'll escort you "],["1954.26","back to the town some would say that's "],["1956.36","what happens after the seven years the "],["1958.1","U-turn hi Jesus and then let's go back "],["1960.559","down "],["1961.94","there's a better custom and that is a "],["1964.1","Jewish custom "],["1965.419","that actually is found in Jesus Hometown "],["1968.6","even "],["1969.62","which says something quite different and "],["1972.679","that is the son is living with his "],["1974.6","father guess where in his father's house "],["1976.7","the groom that is "],["1979.22","and so what happens is this "],["1982.88","the groom in this case Jesus will take "],["1985.22","his bride the church back to his "],["1988.46","father's house and that's literally what "],["1990.08","happens in the Jewish custom is before "],["1993.2","the marriage takes place the son is "],["1995.84","building an add-on to the father's house "],["1997.82","then he goes and fetches his bride the "],["1999.98","father says go get your bride he gets "],["2001.539","the bride and they live in the father's "],["2004.059","house so my question to you is would "],["2006.1","Jesus model his return after a Roman "],["2008.2","Pagan custom or a Jewish custom which "],["2011.559","can be found even in his hometown "],["2013.84","although I don't base things on Customs "],["2015.76","I'm looking at the scriptures primarily "],["2017.32","here "],["2018.159","so here's the bottom line the wrap-up we "],["2021.039","asked is this actually a practical "],["2024.22","Doctrine and the answer is yes verse 16 "],["2028","it says the Lord himself that's in the "],["2030.519","emphatic position the Lord himself in "],["2033.76","person will return "],["2036.58","and that assures that the Rapture will "],["2038.62","happen it says with a shout he'll issue "],["2041.26","an urgent and authoritative summons and "],["2043.48","because of his return and summons his "],["2045.64","children must go up and meet him in the "],["2049.899","air is it practical there it is Verse 18 "],["2052.359","don't miss it I've preached this at many "],["2054.339","a funeral too many funerals I've done in "],["2056.98","my young years especially therefore "],["2059.7","active word there Comfort one another "],["2062.7","with these words well what words in "],["2065.619","particular Paul well there it is verse "],["2067.359","17. and thus we shall always be with the "],["2071.26","Lord when's the last time you comforted "],["2073.06","somebody with those words this is "],["2074.5","actually a command by the way we're "],["2076.419","supposed to

also now that's comfort "],["2089.2","so let's Comfort one another with this "],["2092.2","future reality can you see "],["2095.379","that the Rapture is assured because of "],["2097.66","the Lord's return "],["2099.579","and I think for all of us we need to "],["2101.74","pray for a sense of Joyful anticipation "],["2104.5","as we look daily for Christ's return "],["2107.5","cultivating a love for his appearing we "],["2109.78","can do this it just takes time and "],["2112","prayer and help one to the other "],["2115","let me tell you about my friend he's "],["2116.8","with the Lord now his

"],["2156.64","Italians learn in school broken English "],["2158.38","and so we bridge the gap and so these "],["2160.9","kids my age I was a young guy then uh "],["2163.9","they asked me so you're from the U.S "],["2165.88","what city and I said Chicago ah Chicago "],["2169.839","El cabon bang bang bang "],["2173.2","and I thought I said oh Chicago is known "],["2175.06","for is bang bang bang

"],["2195.46","side note is she eventually became his "],["2197.32","wife but she was a Believer then and he "],["2199.48","was not "],["2200.5","and she said uh no I'm not going to go "],["2203.44","to a dance with you but I'll let you "],["2205","take me to a worship service so that was "],["2206.92","the missionary dating that was that was "],["2209.02","it "],["2210.099","and so they went to Pacific Garden "],["2211.54","Mission downtown Chicago I used to "],["2213.339","preach there it's a mission to people on "],["2215.32","the street who have no home no you know "],["2217.119","they give free food medical it's an "],["2219.04","awesome Ministry "],["2220.24","so anyway they would have a worship "],["2221.859","service constantly they still do it "],["2223.42","today "],["2224.26","in the process of that date he got saved "],["2228.4","he had a date with Jesus really "],["2230.8","Jesus totally transfer I mean totally "],["2233.8","radically transformed his life he was "],["2236.14","sharing the gospel with anybody "],["2237.4","breathing dogs cats squirrels and "],["2239.26","anything that was breathing he would "],["2240.76","share the

"],["2250.06","not pleasing to the Lord what if the "],["2252.099","Lord returns while I'm delivering booze "],["2253.839","right there's a Rapture principle for "],["2255.76","you so anyway he he severed his ties and "],["2258.88","when you do that from their perspective "],["2261.22","you're a dead man "],["2263.099","Vendetta and so he always looked over "],["2265.66","his shoulder for years thinking this is "],["2267.76","my last day it never happened God spared "],["2270.28","him so he began to share his faith and "],["2272.56","and grew grew grew grew grew and so "],["2275.14","finally when I met him I remember I was "],["2278.92","in his house he had a little plaque he "],["2280.48","said young man come over here he said I "],["2282.4","want you to read that and it said you "],["2285.46","are the only Bible that some people will "],["2287.92","ever read you've probably heard that "],["2289.3","before it's on plaques and all that but "],["2291.099","for me as a young guy

"],["391.84","as you see it up here it is one sentence "],["394","it is one term it is one statement the "],["396.16","believer's great commission call we must "],["398.88","first understand that

"],["445.36","missionary or what have you it is for "],["448.16","every believer the great commission is "],["451.84","the mission of the church "],["454.16","and it's not so much that the "],["456.72","the church has a mission but rather the "],["459.039","mission of god has a church "],["462.479","to complete the mission that god began "],["466.639","from the way back in the old

"],["1422.08","the first one let me give you the "],["1423.36","example a pastor says well his church "],["1426.48","will get involved with missions after "],["1428.96","they reach their whole

"],["1451.36","samaria then "],["1452.799","then "],["1453.679","it's an and "],["1455.039","so it means at the same time "],["1456.88","simultaneously taking place "],["1460.32","if what the pastor says about reaching "],["1462.559","his community first then the apostle "],["1464.88","paul's "],["1466","mission trips every one of them would "],["1467.44","have been unscriptural "],["1469.12","think about it in acts 13 when barnabas "],["1471.6","and paul were laid hands on the holy "],["1473.2","spirit separate them unto me and he sent "],["1475.36","them out to do mission

"],["1486.24","see god wants us as a local church to "],["1488.96","reach our community and our nation at "],["1491.52","the same time "],["1493.76","second misconception or mistake of "],["1496.4","interpreting acts 1 8 a pastor says well "],["1499.44","we are not involved with foreign "],["1500.96","missions because our mission field is "],["1502.96","our city "],["1504.32","that's what we're called to because the "],["1506.32","disciples were sent back to jerusalem "],["1509.039","first "],["1510.24","well the pastor's right but only half "],["1512.4","right every church is called to reach "],["1514.559","their jerusalem or the popular "],["1516.4","understanding of their community of "],["1518.799","course "],["1520","that's their

"],["1528.559","hear the gospel "],["1530.64","and as a side note "],["1532.24","you can look at it "],["1533.84","no disciple was from jerusalem "],["1536.64","they came from galilee they were "],["1538.48","fishermen "],["1539.6","they weren't city dwellers in jerusalem "],["1541.44","they were up in the galilee area around "],["1543.679","there being fishermen so why did jesus "],["1545.679","tell them to go to jerusalem "],["1547.6","ah we learned the answer in luke chapter "],["1550","24 "],["1551.2","and he says this "],["1552.72","then he said to them thus it is written "],["1555.2","and thus it was necessary for the christ "],["1558","to suffer and to rise from the dead the "],["1560.559","third day "],["1561.76","and that repentance and remission of "],["1563.679","sins "],["1564.799","should be preached in his name to all "],["1567.679","nations beginning where "],["1570.48","in jerusalem it already began almost 2 "],["1574.4","000 years ago it began in jerusalem and "],["1577.279","it went to samaria and it went to 19 "],["1580.08","other languages and cultures that were "],["1582.08","there on the day of pentecost when they "],["1583.919","heard the disciples speaking in their "],["1586","own language it began to go out and you "],["1588.96","know what it's still continuing to go "],["1591.279","out matter of fact it's gone out so far "],["1593.279","that it even reached you "],["1595.76","and me "],["1596.799","in beaumont texas "],["1599.679","it reached me "],["1601.36","so then we have to ask okay if it began "],["1604.4","in jerusalem and continue to "],["1606.96","ripple out where has it not gone yet "],["1610.32","that's where we need to send people "],["1612.72","now there's people in mechanicsville "],["1615.039","right here who have never heard of the "],["1616.799","name of jesus christ absolutely "],["1619.52","but they have a different access to the "],["1621.6","gospel "],["1622.64","than

they need "],["1632.799","someone to speak to them "],["1636","so you may be asking the question if i'm "],["1637.76","called as a christian to reach my "],["1640.08","community and the world at the

little bit of "],["149.76","background "],["150.959","um we're going to have ellie hugh "],["152.879","talking here "],["154.4","elihu was one of job's friends he was "],["156.64","not one of the three who originally came "],["159.28","to comfort "],["160.959","job um at the beginning of the book that "],["163.519","was so far elephants and bildad so any "],["166.959","new parents coming up

"],["181.92","later and then he offers the last and "],["184.959","the longest uh single speech to job in "],["188.48","job 32-37 "],["190.4","elihu offers a response that lifts up "],["193.12","the lord condemns job's three other "],["196.8","friends and then rightly confronts job "],["200.56","in what he's doing rather than stressing "],["202.239","the idea "],["203.519","that suffering is a punishment for "],["205.84","sinful actions "],["207.68","what elihu does is he concentrate on "],["210.159","job's sinful reaction "],["213.92","to his undeserved "],["216.159","suffering the whole book of job "],["218.08","everything job goes through he doesn't "],["220.4","deserve that "],["222.48","but he but elihu says that job reacts by "],["225.519","questioning the justice of god's ways "],["229.04","and then actually of taking some sort of "],["231.36","perverse pride in doing so "],["238","elihu he advises that job's proper "],["241.2","response should be to recognize his "],["243.599","suffering as get this a charitable "],["246.959","discipline that leads to reconciliation "],["250.64","with god "],["252.4","now elihu also refers to some superhuman "],["255.92","intermediary who will help restore job "],["258.959","to god and he ends his arguments by "],["260.88","stressing god's omnipotence and justice "],["263.52","do you get the intermediary and "],["265.44","everything foreshadowing read the new "],["267.52","testament see what it's foreshadowing "],["269.199","now in job 36-37 elihu highlights god's "],["272.72","greatness and he declares many of god's "],["275.44","attributes in job 36 26 "],["278.8","especially elihu states how great is god "],["282.08","beyond our understanding the number of "],["284.4","his years "],["285.759","is past finding out "],["288.72","elihu rightly points job to god's might "],["292.72","saying listen to this job "],["295.52","i stop and consider "],["297.44","god's wonders that's in

"],["1383.84","faithfully served and asked for one and "],["1386.64","god decided to bless you with one maybe "],["1391.44","or did you ask selfishly "],["1394.159","so god said no and then you didn't even "],["1396.4","get a horse or did you did you "],["1399.52","maybe you had an ulterior motive for "],["1401.28","asking for the horse "],["1403.12","so again god said no or maybe because of "],["1405.84","the alter ulterior motive god actually "],["1408.559","said yes "],["1410","so you thought you were getting what you "],["1411.679","wanted but it turns out you can't handle

"],["341.759","hard at doing things in a way that they "],["344.4","it can go on with altos without us being "],["347.68","having to be there i think that's very "],["349.919","important that's the way it's really "],["351.36","grown we've seen like hundreds of "],["352.8","churches started right dozens and dozens "],["355.12","in various countries and it just adds up "],["356.88","to be a lot and it's because of the "],["358.639","exponential multiplication that happens "],["360.56","because it's not us planting the church "],["362.319","it's us "],["363.84","encouraging them and training them to "],["365.68","plant the churches "],["367.039","themselves "],["369.84","so we have here "],["371.199","the apostle paul's example "],["374.16","you have the missionary "],["376.56","who

"],["388.8","and we do this in a variety of countries "],["392.08","we work in a variety of nations we "],["393.52","travel to "],["395.039","and those we train are themselves going "],["396.96","to other nations and doing this "],["399.28","so it's being done in multiple um "],["400.96","countries and this is that we've really "],["402.88","spent a lot of our time doing helping "],["404.16","them to "],["405.36","do these training conferences but also "],["406.96","spend a lot of time "],["408.4","counseling them or coaching them and "],["410.16","encourage them in this work as they do "],["411.759","it themselves keeping in touch with them "],["413.84","even from here "],["415.599","as they face problems doing this "],["418.16","helping them sort through various issues "],["419.759","they go through "],["421.28","and this here is a "],["424.8","my years ago i shared this slide with "],["427.199","you in this church as you were here "],["430","it was more of a theory back then like a "],["432.16","plan something we hoped "],["433.919","just to have happen but this has "],["436.56","happened now has become a reality in a "],["438.4","variety of different countries we work "],["440.16","in this chain of those we trained "],["442.8","trained others and trained others has "],["444.319","actually come to fruition "],["446.08","and want to say thank you for this thank "],["447.84","you for helping that to come about "],["450.56","because these aren't just numbers or "],["452.16","little "],["453.199","things in that little graph i showed you "],["454.639","these are people's lives "],["457.12","i know it's "],["458.56","here's some of the guys i trained if "],["459.759","ever and he's wearing the little striped "],["461.28","shirt there on the right "],["462.88","he's you know all the and those are "],["464.56","people he trained all the guys were in "],["465.84","their ties for the ones he trains and "],["468","some other guys i trained here "],["470.16","are standing with those they trained "],["473.12","they have these little bible i train "],["474.56","them and they go out and they have these "],["475.919","kinds of groups of "],["477.36","leaders they teach and these people go "],["479.199","back and they start churches in various "],["480.72","villages or "],["482.479","need various churches themselves "],["487.44","we actually should update this has been "],["489.039","some growth since we made this slide and "],["491.199","uh but each black square represents a "],["493.52","church "],["494.56","red triangle represents 10 churches and "],["496.56","the green star represents a bible "],["498.4","institute with a church "],["500.319","that green star thing is actually "],["501.68","multiplied quite a bit "],["503.52","we have some more stuff up in the north "],["505.039","regions now as well this is the country "],["507.039","of benin shaped a bit like a chicken "],["508.8","drumstick "],["510.479","it's about the size and population of "],["512.479","pennsylvania roughly land wise and "],["514.479","population wise "],["516.24","and we've "],["517.76","so the guys we train we trained people "],["519.76","down the south and they in turn went out "],["522.159","and started churches throughout the "],["523.279","country in fact they really need to add "],["524.56","about more stuff in the north almost "],["526.8","every county in the north almost every "],["529.2","county in this nation now has a um "],["532.24","they call them communes was like a "],["533.839","county has a um church in it now except "],["536.64","for a couple of areas in the swamp areas "],["538.72","of that purple area it's actually hard "],["540.48","to get to the purple area and some stuff "],["542.24","in the north "],["544.88","here's in zambia for example "],["547.04","churches have been started there we "],["548.64","train them in the capital and they go "],["550.16","out to other areas "],["552.16","and then it doesn't just stay in those "],["553.6","areas "],["554.88","those be trained have gone out to other "],["556.399","nations "],["558.24","our our zambians have started churches "],["560.8","and bible schools in zimbabwe mozambique "],["563.76","and malawi which neighbor zambia "],["566.88","and actually two in the congo as well in "],["569.12","southern congo "],["571.12","and "],["572.16","our guys in west africa and benin have "],["575.04","moved out to ivory coast "],["577.36","and began bible schools and churches in "],["580.16","ivory coast now i'm "],["582.399","really currently i'm sort of working on "],["584.48","how to help that grow because ivory "],["586.959","coast is a great opportunity and i just "],["589.279","really thrilled to see them do that and "],["591.2","it's a big deal for them because it's "],["592.72","you know they're poor people "],["594.48","foreign and "],["596.24","africa is a big place i just did a thing "],["597.92","of the children okay you could fit "],["599.279","america four times almost four times in "],["602","into africa okay it's huge if you don't "],["604.32","count alaska the united states of "],["606.16","america land-wise could fit into africa "],["608.16","almost four times and "],["609.76","it's a big place for them to go to benin "],["611.519","to ir to ivory coast is like "],["613.76","you know you guys going down to "],["616.8","mexico or something or panama to start "],["619.12","churches you know it's uh "],["620.959","they're doing that but these are not "],["622.8","just little "],["624.88","you know "],["625.76","squares and dots on the map you know "],["627.76","numbers blah blah blah just to just "],["629.92","start it these represent lives these "],["633.12","represent people "],["634.88","people who "],["635.92","sometimes previously are literally "],["637.36","worshiping satan "],["639.68","involved in voodoo demonic religions "],["642.72","they believe in god yeah "],["644.959","there's one one powerful almighty god "],["647.76","who made the world yeah they believe "],["649.12","that throughout africa pretty much but "],["651.36","they don't always know how much god "],["652.8","actually loves them they don't always "],["654.24","know about jesus christ who "],["656.16","freely saves them through dying for them "],["658.399","on the cross they don't know that always "],["660.72","so "],["661.44","these are lives that are being "],["662.56","transformed through jesus christ "],["665.12","across the road their your new brothers "],["667.12","and sisters in christ "],["669.12","so "],["670","instead of me being bogged down and just "],["672.079","you know trying to you know "],["675.76","directly lead these churches it can "],["677.279","really cause a lot of issues we "],["679.519","train them "],["681.6","and they train others who in turn train "],["683.36","others here's some of the guys we've "],["684.48","trained "],["686.16","and these are the guys they trained here "],["689.519","and these guys they thought they're now "],["691.04","training and women are training other "],["692.959","people themselves "],["697.76","so it's "],["698.8","it's um just go back and say i "],["701.279","one just not quite ready for this thank "],["702.72","you the um "],["704.64","that's my fault the uh someone also just "],["706.399","said that "],["707.6","um "],["708.48","africa has a lot of issues when you do "],["710.16","missions work there "],["711.6","could be a lot of problems how many you "],["713.6","know "],["714.32","little i used to love that they're not "],["715.92","up north in america but it's a really "],["717.36","special thing called wawa you have "],["719.279","wobbles around here i saw them passing "],["721.04","by "],["721.839","what a nice thing you guys have they "],["723.2","don't exist up north you know and um "],["726.16","you miss them that stuff and you'd be "],["728.079","surprised how even america could be "],["729.68","different "],["731.92","some missionaries in west africa have a "],["733.6","saying called wawa what's wah-wah mean "],["736.079","huawei means west africa wins again "],["741.279","so many times their problems will just "],["742.959","bog you down there i had some missionary "],["745.12","friends i went to language school with "],["746.48","they "],["747.6","you know caused all the rules going on "],["748.959","they missed three plane flights three "],["750.639","plane flights they had to not be allowed "],["752","on okay just because it's all that's "],["754","going on it's complicated "],["756.079","there "],["756.839","and uh very difficult sometimes "],["760.079","but "],["761.519","i don't know if i spend too much time "],["762.72","going into this but the reality is um "],["765.839","you can really get yourself bogged down "],["767.36","there in life "],["770.079","and issues you face "],["771.839","and i know you god used that to his "],["773.44","glory as you go through challenges and "],["775.279","struggles and you endure them for him "],["778.24","but "],["779.279","when you um "],["781.12","train others themselves to do the work "],["782.88","of the ministry you don't let yourself "],["784.639","be bogged down allows the work to "],["786.16","multiply you train them to go out there "],["788.079","and train others "],["789.68","and so many more people can be reached "],["791.279","for christ that way "],["792.88","and i don't try to make these people "],["794.48","into americans give them american little "],["796.88","rules americanizing their christianity "],["799.36","we just teach the bible line by line "],["802.399","and they take in "],["803.76","in their churches "],["805.6","and teach them contextualize that in "],["807.04","their own culture "],["810.399","our work isn't just um "],["812.24","always "],["813.12","it's mainly we try to teach the bible "],["814.72","and help people to be saved but they're "],["817.2","also we're involved in showing the love "],["818.8","of christ in practical ways here's the "],["820.72","man a man we work with and train "],["823.36","he's meeting the african president he "],["825.44","travels throughout africa he's met "],["828.079","various presidents in africa next slide "],["830.959","he's even briefly met barack obama not "],["833.12","far from you guys in a conference in "],["834.56","washington dc "],["836","he's um actually looking at the camera "],["837.839","there "],["838.639","he's an albino "],["840.639","um some you know some people in africa "],["842.72","are born with you know white skin and um "],["845.68","and they uh helps other albinos in "],["848.24","africa they're sometimes persecuted "],["849.92","because they look different "],["851.76","and they get uh picked on for that "],["854.16","or they also deal with something i face "],["856.32","a bit there and that is sunburn "],["858.959","it's like in fact it's actually worse "],["860.56","for them you know some burn in about 30 "],["862.88","minutes in africa "],["864.56","um he'll burn in like 10 minutes or 15 "],["866.639","minutes so "],["868.24","he trains albinos to have jobs where "],["870.639","they can work inside indoors "],["873.44","that's a nice thing if you sunburn "],["874.959","because africa is not like cloudy "],["877.04","maryland right "],["878.56","and if you can work inside that's great "],["880.88","so he goes around africa training them "],["882.959","help them these various "],["884.8","needs they have and he shares christ why "],["886.639","is that it "],["888.56","we also directly give to some "],["890.88","those who have urgent needs directly "],["892.88","that way the funds aren't always wasted "],["894.639","because sometimes you know in africa the "],["896","money gets "],["897.279","you know it's complicated sometimes but "],["898.639","once sometimes we see a direct problem "],["900.24","people are facing when we give directly "],["901.68","to it the person has a leg that's "],["904.639","infected "],["905.92","sometimes the answer when you have an "],["907.12","infected leg is um "],["909.839","civil war stuff "],["911.44","you know what i mean my civil war stuff "],["912.639","the good old "],["913.76","saw "],["914.959","you know that's the answer to things for "],["916.8","kids adults "],["918.16","they're off goes the arm or leg "],["920.56","and

couple weeks of "],["931.6","antibiotics and stuff "],["933.279","and doctors visits for about 60 "],["935.44","total "],["936.48","will solve those problems "],["938.399","and "],["939.279","people

"],["245.28","um is verses six through seven "],["248.319","because i think these are the pivotal "],["250.4","verses and the root "],["252","of the whole chapter now the first part "],["254.239","of the first thing i wanted to focus on "],["256.56","is verse seven "],["258.4","specifically the word rooted "],["261.359","kind of jumped out of me it comes from "],["262.8","the greek word "],["264.32","redzo oh "],["267.52","this means to cause to take "],["270.08","root "],["271.759","this word or specifically the verb form "],["274.8","of this word is used only twice in all "],["277.28","the new testament okay it's here in "],["279.36","ephesians 3 17. we're going to get to "],["281.28","that "],["283.04","though the noun form root is found at "],["285.84","least 17 times possibly more the point "],["288","is this plant analogy shows up a bunch "],["291.36","in the new testament and then also in "],["292.96","the hebrew the old testament but this "],["295.04","verb form this action form is only used "],["298.479","twice by paul and each time it's "],["301.6","expressing a deep truth about being "],["303.44","rooted specifically in "],["306.08","christ "],["307.919","now the purpose of this taking root is "],["310.24","that we might be built up or established "],["313.52","in him specifically as quote we "],["316.72","were taught "],["318.16","now follow me here "],["320.639","being taught "],["322.56","suggests gaining knowledge "],["327.84","that's kind of what you do "],["329.52","all right but what knowledge were they "],["332.24","or we taught and are we and they gaining "],["336.08","verse six the faith in jesus christ the "],["339.039","lord which they slash we received "],["342.88","it is this knowledge "],["345.199","that allows us to walk in him or to "],["348.639","allow us to live our lives in him "],["353.52","if "],["356.319","we are rooted "],["357.919","in him "],["360.16","for psalms 11 10 says the fear of the "],["362.96","lord is the beginning of wisdom all "],["366.4","those who practice it have a good "],["368.8","understanding "],["370.8","and that's key his praise endures

"],["428.479","true so let's take a look at roots shall "],["431.12","we "],["432.72","why not and then we'll see how they "],["434.479","relate to this truth and wisdom and "],["436.8","understanding in life now i assume that "],["439.759","you all know what roots are "],["442.8","okay so we can skip that aspect of the "],["444.8","botany lesson and we'll just jump ahead "],["447.44","to uh the

"],["482.479","primary function of the root is "],["484.8","absorption "],["486.4","okay they absorb water they absorb "],["488.56","dissolved minerals from the soil and "],["490.479","this is crucial because it helps them in "],["492.479","the process of photosynthesis yay greg i "],["496.16","thought you taught english you're so "],["497.68","good okay "],["500.72","also storage "],["503.039","okay plants prepare food and they store "],["504.96","it in the form of starch in the leaves "],["507.68","in the shoots and in the roots "],["510.72","okay so more food there reproduction "],["515.279","now roots even though they're not part "],["517.2","of the reproductive part of the plant "],["519.519","they are vegetative parts and in some "],["521.839","plants the

an individual "],["69.68","becomes rich "],["74.159","let's start with the example of a person "],["77.2","back in 1997 a man by the name of billy "],["79.84","bob harrell jr was able to answer this "],["82.72","question firsthand when he won 30 "],["86.24","million dollars in the lottery "],["90.24","he planned "],["91.759","to live a life of ease and uh "],["95.84","worry-free living "],["98.24","after quitting his job at the home depot "],["100.72","uh he took his family to hawaii that "],["103.04","sounds lovely he bought a couple of "],["105.04","houses for some friends and and

"],["118.56","he also started to get unwanted "],["120.96","attention from the family and friends he "],["123.439","didn't buy houses for "],["125.36","some of whom he'd not seen "],["127.92","ever "],["130","there were also some other scammers who "],["131.92","were out to kind of find the money he "],["134.4","also made a bad deal with one of those "],["136.4","organizations that pays lump

got separated "],["152.48","his life continued in a spiral which "],["155.68","culminated ultimately with him shooting "],["158.48","himself in the head "],["162.72","before he died "],["164.239","he told his financial advisor "],["166.48","winning the lottery "],["168","was the worst thing "],["169.68","that ever happened to me "],["173.599","and there's a lot of stories like mr "],["175.92","harrell's uh tales of drugs diseases "],["179.28","some things i don't want to get into "],["181.44","we'll just call them a debauchery "],["184.48","and we'll let it go with that

sure we all recall uh mark chapter "],["245.76","10 verse 25 it says it's easier for a "],["248.239","camel to go through the eye of a needle "],["250","than for a rich person to enter the

the "],["722.399","hand of the midian admitting uh seven "],["724.88","years oppression and the hand of midian "],["726.8","overpowered israel and because of midian "],["728.56","the people of israel

"],["736.32","israelites "],["737.68","okay they just weren't 48 000 years ago "],["741.44","for whenever the israelites planted "],["743.04","crops the midianites and the amalekites "],["744.8","and

come in and said my "],["215.28","life is different i would be dead if it "],["216.879","wasn't for rob that would have happened "],["219.2","if he didn't have love "],["220.879","so this morning we're going to read uh "],["222.4","first corinthians 13 just the first "],["224.08","three verses to start and we're going to "],["226.56","look a little bit at this "],["228.64","what i think is the chief christian "],["230.319","virtue of love "],["232.799","he says "],["234.64","paul writes in first corinthians 13 he "],["236.4","says if i speak in the tongues of men "],["238.239","and of angels but have not love "],["241.04","i'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol "],["244.159","and if i have a prophetic powers and "],["246.319","understand all mysteries and all "],["248","knowledge "],["249.04","and if i have all faith so as to remove "],["251.76","mountains "],["253.12","but have not love i am nothing "],["255.439","and if i give all away all i have "],["258.239","and if i deliver up my body to be burned "],["260.799","but have not love "],["262.479","i gain nothing "],["263.919","and let's pray before we dig in a little "],["266.32","bit deeper this morning "],["268.96","father god i thank you so much "],["271.199","for your goodness to us "],["273.04","and for your love and thank you that "],["274.32","we're able to meet together "],["276.56","we just "],["277.52","praise you lord jesus for your love for "],["279.919","us "],["280.72","and we pray that that you would be in "],["282.56","our midst god that you would be pricking "],["284.16","our hearts as to how we can love one "],["287.28","another as you have loved us now we can "],["289.68","have the same mind of christ this "],["291.28","morning that you had when you gave up "],["293.919","your heavenly privilege and you gave up "],["296.08","the joys of heaven to come "],["298.639","and enter our mess "],["300.56","i'm all motivated by love god "],["304.16","and so "],["305.52","jesus name we pray amen "],["308.639","so when i was reading uh this "],["310.96","introduction to 1st corinthians 13 i'm "],["312.72","i'm blown away by the "],["315.039","magnitude of these gifts "],["317.6","that paul lists "],["319.36","that are ultimately either subordinate "],["321.759","to love or ultimately meaningless "],["324.24","without love "],["325.919","i mean these aren't just small things "],["328.16","that he lists "],["329.84","they are "],["330.8","incredibly powerful things "],["332.96","yet they are worthless without love the "],["334.72","first thing he says is if i speak in the "],["336.72","tongues of men or of angels "],["338.8","but i don't have love "],["340.639","i'm only a resounding gong or a clanging "],["342.639","symbol and this refers to a kind of "],["344.56","supernatural a gift of tongues or a kind "],["346.96","of ecstatic utterance "],["349.36","or one is given this ability and paul "],["351.759","talks about this in the very next "],["352.96","chapter "],["354","first corinthians 14 he says "],["356.08","for anyone who speaks in a tongue does "],["358.08","not speak to people but to god "],["360.319","indeed no one understands them they "],["362.24","utter mysteries by the spirit "],["364.96","so paul's saying if i have this ability "],["367.36","to be transported in the spirit to utter "],["369.6","these mysteries "],["371.12","and kind of experience the presence of "],["373.12","god beyond what is normal "],["375.919","beyond what is normative for the "],["377.52","christian life if i had that experience "],["380.639","and yet "],["382.4","don't have love "],["384.16","i'm just a resounding gong i'm just a "],["386.08","clanging symbol i'm just making noise "],["387.84","there's no point to it "],["390.08","it contra it contributes nothing "],["393.039","and then next he says if i have the gift "],["394.319","of prophecy "],["395.68","and can fathom all mysteries and all "],["397.36","knowledge "],["398.88","and prophecy can be uh forth telling "],["402.72","and foretelling so i think a lot of "],["403.919","people we think of prophetic is you're "],["405.68","saying something is going to happen in "],["407.44","the future and "],["408.72","next week this is going to happen and "],["410.16","that can be prophecy but a prophet is "],["412.72","also someone who "],["414.639","just says this is what "],["416.8","god says thus saith the lord he is "],["419.68","explaining what the word of god is and "],["422.16","proclaiming it "],["423.599","and preaching it so i think preachers "],["425.12","who declare the word of god they are in "],["427.36","effect a prophet "],["429.28","they're speaking the words of god "],["431.919","and it's an incredible gift to have "],["433.919","someone i mean we sit under a great "],["435.52","great teaching at faith bible "],["437.44","people who week after week just expound "],["439.919","and and um it's an incredible thing "],["442.319","that's beneficial for us "],["445.12","and then there's also this element of "],["447.199","prophecy can be "],["448.72","speaking something that exactly someone "],["451.199","needs to hear in that moment and god "],["453.28","gives you the words to tell somebody "],["455.12","which is incredible "],["457.44","but paul doesn't stop at that he adds "],["459.599","this thing at the end he says if i have "],["461.52","the gift of prophecy and can fathom all "],["463.919","mysteries and all knowledge "],["466.56","to me this is what what i would like to "],["468.479","have "],["469.52","if i'm honest i would like to "],["471.68","know the word of god and understand it "],["473.599","and the fullness of it i actually think "],["475.68","that churches really are deficient so "],["478.24","often in knowledge of the word of god "],["480.96","we don't know the truth we're so "],["482.319","contented with almost this superficial "],["485.039","surface christianity but let's i want to "],["488","know that the depth of it you know i'm "],["490.08","talking about i want to know the "],["491.12","fullness and and the richness that is "],["493.12","contained in this book "],["495.44","can you imagine having "],["497.12","the ability to fathom all mysteries and "],["500.16","all knowledge "],["503.199","i mean it's it's something incredible to "],["505.28","have an answer to any question that "],["506.639","people have and all the good that that "],["508.319","could do "],["509.36","to the world "],["511.84","i'd like to have that "],["513.279","and then he says "],["514.959","and if i have faith that can move "],["516.479","mountains "],["518.479","i think many of us know exactly the "],["520.32","mountains that we would like to move if "],["522.959","we had this kind of faith we know "],["524.8","exactly the kind of people in our life "],["527.12","that we would we would pray for and "],["529.36","remove those the blinders over their "],["531.36","eyes and the "],["532.959","oppression that they're in "],["534.399","and the chains and shackles that are "],["536.08","that are binding them look at the "],["537.6","commute at our community and and just "],["540.08","the the darkness i'm over sometimes "],["542.56","helping out with the mission and there's "],["544","just people riddled with addiction and "],["546.959","and great pain "],["548.399","and if we could move mountains in this "],["550.64","community and get rid of these spiritual "],["552.88","strongholds and get people to uh be free "],["556.16","from that how incredible would that be "],["559.279","there's so many needs and i think man we "],["562.08","would love to have faith that could "],["563.36","really move mountains "],["565.68","but "],["566.72","what does paul say "],["568.48","you'd have this kind of prophetic gift "],["570.24","you can have the knowledge "],["572.48","and you can have this kind of faith "],["574.8","but if you do not have love he says i am "],["577.2","nothing "],["579.2","i am nothing "],["581.519","and lastly he says if i give all i "],["583.44","possess to the poor "],["585.279","i give my body to hardship "],["589.12","i think who gives everything they have "],["591.04","to the poor 10 percent is enough on a "],["593.6","sunday "],["594.8","but give everything "],["596.959","someone who "],["598.64","exhausts all their possessions to the "],["600.72","poor "],["602.64","and is it almost how can you how can "],["604.399","someone give everything they have to the "],["606","poor and yet not have love it seems such "],["607.76","a counter-intuitive thing but "],["610.079","i think there's a warning here that even "],["612.48","the best things that we do if done "],["614.16","without love "],["615.6","if done that we may boast "],["618.079","are dangerous "],["619.6","and fruitless "],["622.8","and then he says give up my body to "],["624.16","hardship and the one translation that i "],["626.079","had "],["627.12","memorized as a younger kid at kca was if "],["630","i give up my body "],["631.68","to be burned "],["633.279","and this image of a martyr at a stake "],["636.64","giving up my body to be burned i think "],["638.56","what could be higher than to die "],["641.36","for the faith or to die for for christ "],["644.56","and yet this highest work that a "],["647.44","christian can do in my mind "],["649.68","this ultimate thing to give up your very "],["652.32","life "],["654.32","he says if i don't have love i gain "],["656.959","nothing i gain nothing from giving up my "],["659.6","life and giving all my possessions away "],["661.519","to the poor if i don't "],["663.2","have love unless i possess love "],["666.88","so it's such an extreme language that "],["669.04","paul uses and i think he's doing this to "],["670.72","hammer the point home that love is a "],["672.959","necessity in the christian's life "],["676.32","as a necessity it doesn't matter the "],["677.76","good works we do "],["679.519","for jesus it doesn't matter the power or "],["682","the giftedness that we possess in our "],["684","ministry "],["686","if we lack this key ingredient "],["688.72","it's all waste it's all pointless "],["691.6","it's not to say again that these things "],["693.04","aren't are um "],["694.64","not important things that we should be "],["696.16","seeking to know the word of god to "],["699.04","to give up things to the poor and to "],["701.04","care for others "],["702.56","but if we don't have love "],["704.8","they mean nothing they're like almost "],["706.8","sales to a ship and they can all be out "],["709.519","but without the wind "],["711.44","pushing it it doesn't go anywhere "],["714.16","or tools in the hand of someone who "],["716.079","doesn't know how to use them a kid "],["718.079","he doesn't it doesn't do anything "],["719.68","because there is nothing driving there's "],["721.92","no there's no uh force behind it "],["724.88","they're useless apart from this chief "],["726.56","virtue "],["728","of "],["728.839","love colossians 3 12 to 14 "],["732.959","says this "],["734.48","therefore as god's chosen people "],["737.04","holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves "],["739.76","with compassion "],["741.36","kindness "],["742.8","humility gentleness and patience "],["745.68","bear with each other and forgive one "],["747.36","another "],["748.72","if any of you has a grievance against "],["750.639","someone "],["752","forgive as the lord forgave you "],["754.639","and over all these virtues put on love "],["758.16","which binds them all together in perfect "],["760.24","unity "],["761.36","so in everything we do "],["763.6","we need love to be binding together "],["766.959","at all in perfect unity "],["769.2","i think this is the key ingredient for "],["771.04","christian in uh in the christian life i "],["774.639","know uh with christmas many of you uh "],["777.279","women and maybe some of you guys were "],["778.88","baking i'm not much of a baker "],["782.56","and my mom and my my aunt are incredible "],["785.519","bakers but "],["786.959","it's almost "],["788.24","the chief ingredient i think "],["790.399","there's a lot of cheap ingredients you "],["791.6","need when you're baking something but it "],["793.44","doesn't matter what kind of eggs you "],["795.12","have or the the if they're "],["797.68","you know free-range chickens or the "],["800","flour how fine and and good the flour is "],["802.959","but if you don't have um if you don't "],["805.279","have flour right so if you don't have "],["807.279","flour you're not gonna have a cake "],["809.519","you're not gonna have a cake okay you "],["811.44","need that chief ingredient to be in the "],["813.76","cake or else you won't have a cake in "],["815.68","the same manner love is like that if you "],["817.2","don't have love "],["818.88","if it's not in everything we're doing if "],["820.639","not running alongside what we're doing "],["822.88","and over it "],["824.56","all our efforts "],["826.079","will be in vain "],["828.56","so "],["829.6","what is true love "],["831.839","there are a lot of misconceptions about "],["834.079","love today and i actually think that "],["836","it's easy for us who are true uh "],["838.24","bible-believing christians "],["840.079","to maybe shy away from coming faces with "],["843.04","a passage like first corinthians 13 "],["845.6","because of how often we hear people talk "],["847.839","about love "],["849.6","in the world "],["851.36","and they've taken this term and kind of "],["852.88","infused it with new meaning "],["854.959","where love is something that is "],["856.16","accepting at all cost it is "],["858.24","inclusive "],["859.68","it doesn't pay regard to the truth or "],["861.68","the "],["862.56","long-term end of a person where that "],["864.639","person will end up if they continue "],["866.32","there it just accepts no matter what "],["869.279","and because true christianity is not "],["871.44","that that those things it's not "],["873.6","inclusive "],["875.519","it's not accepting all people because it "],["878.24","commands men everywhere to repent "],["881.04","and because it commands people to come "],["882.56","to jesus christ for forgiveness we are "],["884.88","deemed by the world to not have this "],["886.48","quality of love "],["888.48","and so maybe i think uh i'll do this "],["891.04","i'll i'll maybe emphasize truth truth "],["893.199","truth truth "],["894.72","and maybe neglect "],["896.56","this important ingredient of love "],["900.56","but the world does not have "],["902.48","the proper definition of love they don't "],["904.16","have "],["905.199","this first corinthians 13 "],["907.199","definition of love this is our our book "],["910.079","this is what god has given to us so we "],["911.839","should not fear uh going to the very "],["914","depths and the very limits of this "],["915.76","passage "],["917.199","out of out of fear of maybe becoming "],["919.519","soft or becoming compromising no this is "],["922","for us "],["923.44","and this is god's definition that we "],["925.199","have and so this is how god defines it "],["927.76","in verse four he says "],["929.839","love is patient "],["931.519","love is kind "],["933.519","love is patient it talks about how "],["935.68","the king james says charity suffereth "],["938.399","long "],["939.68","it "],["940.56","bears through pain "],["942.72","and can handle "],["944.56","some struggles "],["945.92","it love is kind it does not envy "],["948.8","it does not boast "],["950.48","it is not proud "],["952.24","it does not dishonor others it is not "],["954.32","self-seeking "],["956","it is not easily angered "],["958.24","it keeps no record of wrongs "],["960.88","love does not delight in evil but "],["962.88","rejoices with the truth "],["965.199","it always protects always trusts always "],["968","hopes "],["969.199","always perseveres "],["971.199","love never fails "],["974.16","so love is "],["976.959","this dominant christian virtue and it "],["978.56","ties everything we do together as we've "],["980.839","discussed and the word used for love as "],["983.04","many of you know is "],["984.8","agape "],["986.24","this highest form of what of love the "],["988.32","strongest type "],["990.24","one that is self-giving "],["992.48","and self-sacrificing "],["994.56","now today when we talk about love today "],["996.24","we often mean a romantic feeling as in i "],["999.199","love my wife or i love this person "],["1002.56","or we use love almost as another word "],["1004.48","for like "],["1005.6","i love this movie "],["1010.32","love is so often understood as this uh "],["1012.399","emotion or strong feeling that kind of "],["1014.24","comes and goes "],["1015.6","and we almost love things because they "],["1017.839","give us something in return because i "],["1020.24","get some value or i get "],["1022.32","a good feeling from this person i love "],["1024","them "],["1025.36","but that love can go and that feeling "],["1026.799","can go and so often we hear people say "],["1028.64","well i no longer love this person i no "],["1031.12","longer have feelings for this person "],["1033.76","but that is not "],["1035.439","this first corinthians 13 definition of "],["1037.679","love "],["1039.039","love is something that persists "],["1041.679","it's something that does not fail "],["1044.24","something doesn't exalt the self or make "],["1046.16","us grow in the eyes of others it's not "],["1049.039","motivated by just self preservation "],["1051.84","it's it's patient "],["1053.52","it's kind it's not self-seeking it's "],["1055.36","something that is determined and "],["1056.799","resolved to endure to the end "],["1060.08","no matter the cost "],["1062.4","it something that gives and gives and "],["1064.559","gives "],["1066.4","and in many ways i keep thinking of rob "],["1068.4","myers in that funeral "],["1070.48","um a week and a half ago "],["1073.039","and richard when he was up here at the "],["1074.4","end he was telling a story about "],["1076.799","a story that rob loved "],["1078.799","and "],["1080.24","rob loved the story of this man i think "],["1082","it's from the book the intercessor i'm "],["1083.52","not sure "],["1084.4","but there's a man who was working among "],["1087.28","people who were poor and every day the "],["1089.6","same guy would ask him for his jacket "],["1092.08","and every day that guy just gave him his "],["1094.72","jacket and the next day would come and "],["1096.08","he'd "],["1096.799","the same guy would ask him for his "],["1097.84","jacket and he kept giving it giving it "],["1099.28","to him "],["1100.48","the day after that he'd give his jacket "],["1101.84","again just kept "],["1103.28","kept giving his jacket and "],["1105.44","um "],["1106.64","rob loved that story "],["1108.48","i think a lot of us may laugh and think "],["1110.08","that's such a i mean that guy's "],["1112.32","not really exhibiting much wisdom uh "],["1115.12","you're getting played he's so obvious "],["1116.799","he's just stealing your jacket again and "],["1118.4","again "],["1120","um i think i we could debate actually "],["1122.48","from the bible is that actually the best "],["1124.72","way uh to to "],["1127.52","love people "],["1129.28","you know uh the bible says that we're to "],["1131.12","be christ tells us that we're to be wise "],["1133.6","as serpents "],["1135.12","and "],["1136.48","gentle as doves "],["1138.08","so there's a wisdom that needs to "],["1139.2","accompany it right "],["1140.799","philippians 1 9 "],["1143.12","he said "],["1144.08","paul writes this and this is my prayer "],["1145.6","that your love may abound more and more "],["1147.84","in knowledge and depth of insight so "],["1150","that you may be able to

"],["1670.799","others in that same manner "],["1673.679","i think this is the way christianity is "],["1675.12","supposed to work "],["1676.399","we love "],["1677.6","why "],["1679.039","because he first loved us "],["1681.52","jesus says a new commandment i give to "],["1683.52","you that you love one another "],["1685.44","as i have loved you "],["1688","first john 3 16 says this this is how we "],["1690.32","know what love is jesus christ laid down "],["1692.88","his life for us "],["1694.399","and we ought to lay down our lives for "],["1696.72","our brothers and sisters "],["1699.2","so jesus is the model yes he's the "],["1701.12","example "],["1702.559","but he's also this motivating power he's "],["1705.2","also this source that feeds our love and "],["1707.52","enables us to walk "],["1709.44","in the same way so this is the key "],["1711.039","experiencing the love of christ "],["1714.159","once we experience that once we taste of "],["1716.64","that richness "],["1718.24","we can't help but deal similarly with "],["1720.72","others we can't help it "],["1722.96","it's like one of those garden fountains "],["1725.039","where

"],["1734.72","over time "],["1736.399","but if you have this new water flowing "],["1738.64","into you "],["1740.32","you're gonna you can't help but "],["1741.84","continually pour out "],["1743.52","and overflow into others give that same "],["1745.84","love you've received outward you can try "],["1748.159","to keep it in but it you can't it's it's "],["1750.08","too much it's too

"],["115.84","and so god we just thank you for "],["118.159","uh the fellowship we thank you for this "],["120.079","place that you've created we thank you "],["122.159","for the leadership "],["123.759","and we just pray god that we would honor "],["125.6","you and we would be more "],["128.8","like the way you want us to be "],["131.599","even as we do all these missions and all "],["134","these things "],["136.239","help us to be who you want us to be "],["140.64","i pray that you would speak uh through "],["143.36","me today "],["145.04","as i report the work that you're doing "],["148.08","in east africa and that you would "],["149.92","encourage us as "],["151.519","as a body of people who want to live "],["153.76","like jesus until we see the grave "],["156.959","that we would just honor you in all that "],["158.72","we do "],["159.68","in jesus name amen "],["164","so i'd like to read just a short passage "],["166.08","and then i'm going to ask you to do "],["167.12","something really weird "],["168.959","so i'm a missionary so i'm allowed to do "],["170.56","that i'm i'm gonna ask you to do "],["172.8","something maybe a little bit "],["174","uncomfortable but i think they really "],["175.599","went well in the first service so i'm "],["176.879","expecting you guys to "],["178.48","to step up all right this is a passage i "],["181.12","want to read in first corinthians "],["183.36","and it says this uh "],["185.68","now we have this treasure "],["188.319","secretary chapter four verse seven we "],["189.84","have this treasure in clay jars "],["191.92","so this extraordinary power may be from "],["194.56","god "],["196","and not from us we are pressured in "],["199.2","every way but are not crushed "],["202.239","we are perplexed but not in despair "],["206.239","we are persecuted but not abandoned "],["209.2","we are struck down but not destroyed "],["212.239","we always carry the death of jesus in "],["214.159","our body so that the life of jesus may "],["216","be also revealed in our body "],["218.56","for we who live are always given over to "],["220.56","death because of jesus "],["223.12","so that jesus life may also be revealed "],["225.04","in our mortal flesh "],["227.519","so death works in us but life "],["230.48","in you "],["233.519","and ii corinthians paul talks quite a "],["235.28","bit about the persecution and the "],["236.959","difficulty it was as he was living as a "],["239.519","missionary as he was planting churches "],["242.239","and his single focus to glorify god and "],["244.48","all that he did "],["245.84","and to help other people "],["247.599","to know "],["248.799","the power of jesus and the hope "],["251.2","that they have "],["255.28","you might not be a missionary today you "],["258.16","might do "],["259.12","another kind of evangelism but if you're "],["260.959","looking to "],["262.56","share the gospel and honor god with your "],["264.4","life "],["265.759","it can feel like this "],["270.24","and as long as we see ourselves as jars "],["272.88","of clay and we remind ourselves i'm just "],["275.12","a jar of clay "],["277.28","the powers of god "],["279.199","to do what i need to "],["280.84","do and i don't know what it is that "],["285.12","you went through this week and i don't "],["286.56","know what you've been going through in "],["288.08","the last year "],["291.68","but i want to encourage you today that "],["293.28","god "],["294.08","knows "],["296.4","he does "],["298.56","and we just came from a conference and "],["300.8","and i just wanted to share this "],["303.12","as i was given this gift i want to share "],["305.28","it with you "],["306.56","and i just want to ask you "],["308.32","to just take a look at me for a minute "],["311.12","i'm just going to look at each of you "],["313.52","and i just want you to know that i see "],["315.52","you "],["317.6","and that god sees you "],["326.72","and i don't know your story but god does "],["349.68","and god sees you just where you're at "],["355.28","and his grace is sufficient "],["374.24","i'm trying to look at everyone there's a "],["375.52","lot of people in this room "],["378.639","trying not to go too fast "],["397.759","it's the beautiful thing about the "],["399.039","gospel that "],["401.039","god sees each of us "],["403.44","and when i came to christ over 20 years "],["405.52","ago i think that was the difference from "],["407.039","what i heard about jesus and what i came "],["408.88","to know "],["410.08","i knew that jesus died on a cross to "],["412.4","save our sins i could repeat that you "],["414.319","know "],["415.12","but it really became personal to me "],["418.319","and i came to know that jesus came for "],["420.88","each of us "],["422.479","and so i i pray that you would just know "],["424.96","that this morning "],["426.56","and i want to give you a chance to "],["427.68","practice it just real quick one more "],["429.52","thing i'm going to ask you to do "],["432","so that you know that god sees you "],["435.28","and so that we can see each other "],["438.8","and so i just want you to take 10 "],["440.16","seconds "],["441.759","and look into the eyes of your neighbor "],["445.039","and "],["446.08","just say i see you "],["455.039","and then you'll have a chance to return "],["456.4","it after you've done that "],["459.68","then the other person "],["461.12","can look at "],["462.319","you or someone else and "],["464.4","say i see "],["476.84","um it's important that that we do that "],["479.84","um you know one of the blessings of "],["481.68","living overseas is you know we come from "],["484.24","a wonderful country where "],["486","where you all and so many people help us "],["488.08","to be "],["489.599","and to serve people that you've never "],["491.039","even met i think that's just an "],["492.8","incredible thing "],["494.56","and we can try to share with you as much "],["496.479","as we can "],["497.84","what it's like and what's going on "],["501.84","but really you're operating by faith "],["504.08","and sending us "],["505.52","there "],["507.199","and faith in what god is "],["509.28","doing "],["512.08","and um "],["515.2","one of the things i think that i think "],["516.719","that i learned from living in another "],["519.279","culture "],["520.64","is that we are so busy sometimes we "],["523.039","don't take time "],["524.72","for each other just take time to be "],["527.92","and to remember that our value is "],["531.279","and who god says that we are "],["534.48","so i hope that's an encouragement to "],["535.92","someone today "],["539.68","so this is our family as we seek to "],["542.8","be "],["543.6","jesus "],["544.88","as we seek to reach people for jesus and "],["547.6","as we seek to send people "],["551.279","to lead other people to jesus this is "],["553.2","our family "],["554.48","this is my wife she asked me not to have "],["556.24","her stand up so just say hi to her "],["560.399","i still embarrassed her sorry "],["562.399","um but i'm just really thankful for her "],["565.2","being with me on this journey and "],["567.839","i don't get tired of saying that because "],["569.6","i know the things that she has given up "],["572.24","and the things that she does to help "],["575.36","make this gospel available to people and "],["577.68","so i'm thankful for that "],["579.68","and what she sacrifices for that "],["582.32","uh these are our two boys uh christopher "],["584.64","and caleb "],["586","uh christopher's eleven "],["588.32","uh caleb is nine he's the dorky one "],["591.519","if you've seen that video "],["594.32","um so love them "],["596.48","uh love doing life with them and again "],["599.12","very thankful for them as well "],["601.04","and what they do in terms of being with "],["603.6","me and just going to all the places we "],["605.68","go and "],["606.959","they're with their grandparents today "],["609.6","so "],["610.72","we were at a conference this week like i "],["612.079","said so they were with their "],["613.12","grandparents "],["614.88","eating too much food i'm sure "],["618.959","so we're living in dar salaam tanzania "],["620.8","the second fastest growing city in the "],["622.32","world "],["623.279","we're the east africa mission we partner "],["625.04","with different people and one the "],["627.04","organization that helps "],["628.88","cover us is called global service "],["630.72","network and so we are a team of people "],["634.88","who are seeking to know more about "],["636.56","missions "],["637.68","and seeking to make god's glory known in "],["640.399","the best way that we know so as we know "],["642.959","more we as "],["644.32","as we know a better we should do better "],["646.959","and so we're constantly in the state of "],["648.88","learning about missions learning what "],["650.24","god is doing "],["651.44","working together with nationals "],["654.64","in a way that can best bring glory to "],["656.48","god and their culture "],["658.8","and so that's kind of our heart "],["662","and so we we specifically target "],["664.24","unreached peoples "],["666.24","people who don't have a chance to hear "],["667.92","the gospel "],["669.44","people where "],["672.399","i don't even know if i know how to "],["673.76","describe it how hard it would be "],["677.04","to actually hear the gospel how far they "],["679.519","would actually need to go "],["682.959","and so "],["684.16","that's "],["685.76","and that's what we do "],["687.12","um we're looking for these people groups "],["689.519","and looking what god is doing nearby or "],["692.399","in there somewhere and we try to partner "],["694.72","with people luke chapter 10 talks about "],["696.48","a person of peace "],["698","somebody who's interested in learning "],["699.839","something "],["700.959","without getting anything in return "],["703.44","and they can teach us about the culture "],["705.12","and we can teach them about what we know "],["707.6","about jesus "],["710","and we also look for people who have "],["712.16","really no hope of "],["714.079","of advancing their life because of the "],["716.72","the situation society that they're in "],["719.44","and so we look to give them skills to so "],["722","they would think about what they can do "],["724.079","god has given them skills already how "],["726.56","can we help them think about how to do "],["728.16","that "],["728.959","in their community "],["730.48","okay "],["732.16","and so this is uh this is us this is us "],["734.959","at the community center "],["737.2","this is um "],["738.56","one of the gentlemen that "],["742.079","got an internship he finishes internship "],["744.72","program with us "],["746","and our core values "],["748","love so we love in the way that we learn "],["751.04","listen "],["752.079","and share ideas with people "],["754.88","we empower by asking people "],["757.2","what do you have "],["758.56","in your hands "],["760","so there's always something god has "],["761.76","given people what can you do with "],["765.04","what you have instead of thinking i just "],["767.279","can get "],["768.56","from someone else what do you have in "],["770.24","your hands what can we do with that "],["772.399","it gives dignity to people "],["774.8","send so we look to disciple people to a "],["777.6","place where they can be sent "],["779.76","into their communities to represent "],["782.16","jesus "],["784","and partner "],["785.76","so partner if we're going to reach a "],["787.44","city this big "],["788.959","and "],["789.76","knowing that there's other cities as "],["791.2","well there's so many people unreached "],["793.04","people to to reach we need to partner "],["795.36","with other people to best "],["797.519","reach the people "],["800.88","so we're along the coast of east africa "],["802.56","if you were like me a few years ago i "],["804.48","really didn't africa was you know "],["807.279","it was something i had to learn about "],["808.56","and we just showed in the kids section "],["810.72","how big africa is you can fit the united "],["812.88","states china india "],["814.88","most of europe "],["816.32","into "],["817.279","africa it's that big "],["819.279","so each country each people is a little "],["821.6","different "],["823.199","and so we're working along the coast "],["826.079","uh mostly with the swahili people "],["829.199","and we look for people of peace like my "],["830.8","friend i'll call him matthew he is one "],["833.12","of our primary people of peace he's "],["834.72","doing a phenomenal job uh it would mean "],["837.199","a lot to me if you would pray for him "],["838.639","when you think of us you can pray for "],["840","him "],["841.12","um he this is him after one of our "],["843.839","soccer events "],["845.199","going through the three circles "],["846.56","evangelism is anyone familiar with the "],["848.24","three circles "],["849.839","it's a popular uh tool that's used and "],["851.76","it works really really well in east "],["853.92","africa because you can adapt the story "],["856.399","in a way that makes sense "],["859.76","but that's where we're at "],["863.76","why do we do what we do "],["865.839","i mean this is our passion this is why "],["867.76","we go "],["868.959","in earthen vessels we depend on the "],["872.16","power of god "],["873.519","because of this "],["875.12","uh this good news of the kingdom will be "],["876.88","proclaimed in all the world as a "],["878.56","testimony to all "],["881.12","ethnic "],["882.32","and then the end will come and your "],["884.639","bible what does it say it doesn't say "],["886.72","ethnic what does your bible say "],["889.44","all the world what's another version say "],["896.8","i heard somebody "],["898.56","maybe it says nations "],["900.48","okay when you think of nations what do "],["901.839","you think of "],["903.92","think of a country right "],["906.16","think of like a large group right but if "],["908.72","you hear the word acne which is the "],["910.079","original word what do you think of "],["913.36","ethnicities right and so some a lot of "],["915.6","work has been done in in by "],["917.519","missiologists and even people like john "],["919.92","piper who wrote let the nations be glad "],["922.16","he's really focusing on the meaning of "],["923.92","these words and it really has the idea "],["926.399","like in genesis the english version of "],["928.48","genesis chapter 12 "],["930.72","god tells abraham that in you and "],["933.279","another place he says in your seed "],["936.56","all the families of the earth will be "],["938.56","blessed "],["940.959","and the idea is smaller groups of people "],["942.959","than we would think of in terms of "],["944.32","nations "],["947.759","so "],["949.199","how "],["950.16","the idea is how do we get "],["953.12","all the nations all the "],["955.279","not just nations but all the ethnic "],["958.32","to have an opportunity to clearly hear "],["960.639","the gospel "],["962.72","and sometimes it's going to a country "],["965.12","and saying okay this is where the gospel "],["967.12","is hey why don't you guys push out to "],["969.04","this place have you thought about this "],["971.04","what do you need to get to this area "],["974.72","why have you not gone yet and to have "],["976.8","those discussions and help people "],["981.6","but there's a there's there's a direct "],["983.92","connection between the gospel going "],["986.639","to these ethnic groups "],["988.88","and the end "],["990.56","it's very important to jesus and and we "],["992.48","could go through a ton of scriptures so "],["994.8","there's a class called the perspectives "],["996.32","class which we're connected with some of "],["997.92","those people and this it's a phenomenal "],["999.92","class it changed my view of missions and "],["1002.32","how we do evangelism and it's the idea "],["1004.88","of "],["1005.839","how do we get to these other areas "],["1011.68","in matthew 28 18-20 he says go and make "],["1014.48","disciples of "],["1016","all the ethnic right "],["1019.199","in revelation it says that there will be "],["1021.44","people from every tribe "],["1023.44","ton "],["1024.319","people and nation "],["1027.839","and so how do we work together as a "],["1029.36","church if we want to see god's glory we "],["1031.36","really want to see god's "],["1032.959","ultimate plan how do we "],["1035.199","think about these people so they have a "],["1037.52","chance "],["1040","they have a chance to hear "],["1043.36","only 0.1 percent of mission budgets of "],["1046.319","u.s churches goes to unreached peoples "],["1049.76","so that's different but as a whole "],["1051.6","that's the statistic that seems to be "],["1053.52","coming up "],["1055.12","so it goes to good causes it goes to "],["1057.2","good things that help people but "],["1059.84","a lot of times it doesn't get "],["1061.84","to the areas that's most needed "],["1064.64","where people can have a chance to hear "],["1070.4","so how are we doing this in east africa "],["1072.559","um so we're doing it and we do three "],["1076.08","broad types of ministry and then i'll "],["1077.84","tell you at the end how do we kind of "],["1079.679","tie it all together "],["1081.44","but we use this as in a way of engaging "],["1083.919","people these are three primary things "],["1085.76","that we do "],["1086.799","and i'm going to ask my wife to come up "],["1088.16","in a minute "],["1089.84","but the one thing that we do is "],["1091.6","community interaction and development "],["1094.4","so we talked about some of our core "],["1096.4","values and these are some of the things "],["1098.4","that we've done "],["1099.84","just with the football club "],["1102.24","of course you know to soccer they call "],["1103.6","it football there "],["1106.24","football is like life there it's "],["1108.08","everything "],["1109.2","they'll miss meals they'll do all kinds "],["1111.44","of stuff to go see a football game on tv "],["1114.08","or to play you know it's just what they "],["1115.919","do "],["1116.72","um and so we engage in that okay "],["1121.28","so we engage them where they're at "],["1124.08","i remember when we first got there "],["1127.52","my friend "],["1132.48","my friend here he's actually in the "],["1133.76","bottom right corner uh so he's from "],["1136.4","europe and he was a missionary so we "],["1138.08","served together "],["1139.44","uh but then the the last time that we "],["1141.919","came back he had to go he had some "],["1144.16","family matters to go back home and so he "],["1145.84","asked me to run the football club "],["1148","and "],["1149.28","um "],["1151.28","and so the first so we started to get "],["1152.88","into these leagues "],["1154.48","and "],["1155.6","uh we got into this league and and our "],["1158","team was doing pretty well "],["1160.08","and um so we had of course we had some "],["1162.48","of the guys i work with were coaching "],["1164","and stuff "],["1165.039","and um so but then they started "],["1167.84","i started hearing stories of this "],["1169.28","witchcraft going on and then putting "],["1171.28","things around the field and "],["1173.679","paying off the ref it looked pretty "],["1175.6","obvious some stuff was going on and um "],["1178.72","so then the one match they they couldn't "],["1180.72","win they were calling me "],["1183.6","which means the white witch "],["1185.919","and um "],["1187.039","so but what they ended up doing was um "],["1190.32","our team won and they just kind of "],["1192.08","started a big fight with us "],["1194.16","so thankfully all the kids got home "],["1195.76","safely and everything "],["1197.28","but we said from that "],["1200.4","why don't we "],["1202.559","we have a vision for what we want to do "],["1204.64","with this "],["1205.6","i think we have some people that want to "],["1206.96","help us in the community "],["1208.88","why don't we try to meet and get people "],["1210.48","together "],["1212.08","and try to start our own "],["1214.159","okay "],["1216.72","so "],["1217.919","we got people together in the community "],["1219.919","in something called uh bonanzas if you "],["1221.919","could go to that one "],["1223.76","and and so they're like tournaments and "],["1225.76","so we got people together we got the ref "],["1227.44","to bring him in so people can see hey "],["1228.96","this is not about us we're going to do "],["1230.799","things fairly and there's not going to "],["1232.64","be any cursing you're not gonna talk "],["1234","back to your coach or to the ref we're "],["1236","gonna shake hands at the end of the game "],["1237.919","we'd give awards out for people who "],["1240.08","demonstrate a good character for some of "],["1242.32","the best players coaches and try to just "],["1244.48","honor people "],["1245.679","and and it was really really awesome "],["1248.64","one of the bonanzas that we got to do "],["1250.799","was over 400 people between the teams "],["1253.44","and the community leaders that came out "],["1256","um so i'm just really thankful for that "],["1259.12","ministry and that's one of the things "],["1260.559","we're able to do if you can just go back "],["1262.64","a slide i kind of jumped ahead "],["1265.76","so our vision for "],["1268.64","agape is helping youth make good life "],["1270.559","decisions "],["1271.679","that reflect god's love for them "],["1273.84","and their love for others and for "],["1275.84","excellence on the football field "],["1278.32","so we had uh the guy on the bottom left "],["1280.96","is a guy named evo mopunda he's a "],["1283.28","professional soccer player retired "],["1285.76","so we hear more about him later "],["1288","but he was a great partner in what we "],["1289.52","did and this is christopher sharing his "],["1293.679","story with the kids "],["1295.919","at one of the bonanzas "],["1297.6","so "],["1298.32","okay "],["1301.919","okay so i'm asked my wife to come up at "],["1303.84","this point "],["1304.96","um so this is life and work skills a lot "],["1307.919","of that is uh small business development "],["1310.96","and she's gonna tell you a little bit "],["1312.559","about how she uses that "],["1314.799","in tanzania "],["1318.799","good morning "],["1320.799","like um chris mentioned my name is anne "],["1323.039","and i have a privilege of working with "],["1326.159","many things in the east africa mission "],["1327.919","but one of the things that i get to do "],["1330.24","is "],["1331.12","to do the life and work skill "],["1333.039","development "],["1334.48","one of the ways that we do that is "],["1336.559","through a ministry of baking "],["1338.799","and this ministry was started by a "],["1341.12","couple who have been "],["1343.039","missionaries in tanzania for about 20 "],["1344.96","years and they used to live in a village "],["1348.08","and they used they were trying to find "],["1349.679","ways to minister with the ladies in the "],["1351.84","village "],["1352.799","and so this lady currently um "],["1355.919","developed a recipe "],["1358.159","of cakes that they can use without any "],["1361.2","special ingredients they use everything "],["1363.039","that they have in the everyday home and "],["1365.28","what happens with these cakes is "],["1367.52","two things "],["1368.72","the first thing is that they give the "],["1370.32","opportunity to the ladies to be able to "],["1373.52","provide for their families in small "],["1375.84","different ways "],["1377.36","there's a lot of celebrations that go on "],["1379.919","and during all the celebrations they "],["1381.84","usually have cake so cake is an "],["1383.76","opportunity for them to be able to sell "],["1385.6","it and provide for their families but "],["1388.24","the other thing that they get to do is "],["1390.4","they get to use it as an opportunity to "],["1392.72","share with their neighbors "],["1394.48","the gospel so "],["1397.2","we do it we do the training in different "],["1399.2","steps but the first step is you watch us "],["1402.4","do it the second step you do we do it "],["1405.039","together the third step you do it and "],["1406.72","bring it to us and the fourth step is "],["1409.919","you do it and you go share with your "],["1411.679","neighbor and share the gospel with your "],["1413.679","neighbor through that and so that's just "],["1416.159","one of the many opportunities that we "],["1417.76","get to serve the ladies in tanzania "],["1426.16","[Applause] "],["1430.72","i'm not a big cake person but these are "],["1432.72","pretty good "],["1434.559","and they usually put like the local "],["1436","fruits the passion or mango they able to "],["1438.559","get it in the cake so it's really a "],["1440","great thing "],["1441.36","um "],["1445.36","yes "],["1446.96","uh so there's a another thing that we're "],["1449.12","able to do here's one example of of how "],["1451.12","we partner with people so some friends "],["1453.12","of ours "],["1454.159","from from dc where we served for a "],["1456.88","number of years uh they're they're "],["1459.6","leading entrepreneurs um in the states "],["1462.559","and so they want they want to come and "],["1464.32","find out how they could help how they "],["1465.52","could serve and so we had them come over "],["1467.919","and um "],["1469.76","they we put together a training of about "],["1471.6","50 people for three nights "],["1473.76","and we did some other things with them "],["1475.12","but this was really really good it was "],["1477.52","getting people interacting and thinking "],["1479.44","about their business "],["1480.88","and how they can use biblical principles "],["1482.64","both in terms of having integrity and "],["1485.039","how god blesses integrity and as well as "],["1488","being "],["1488.88","a light to the people around them "],["1491.36","and so we're just really thankful for "],["1492.88","them to come and it really it really "],["1495.12","brought a lot of people together and to "],["1497.12","think about how can i live and work in a "],["1499.2","way that honors god "],["1503.6","this is them at our community center and "],["1506.32","just working together with our "],["1507.44","leadership team "],["1508.96","and that was kind of the theme "],["1510.559","developing a kingdom-minded business "],["1516.08","so the third thing that we do here "],["1518.48","so the first one was community "],["1520.4","interaction and development "],["1522.159","and then "],["1523.52","life and small business development or "],["1525.52","work skills "],["1526.88","and the third way that we engage the "],["1528.96","community is really my passion it's "],["1530.72","really the the main thing that we want "],["1532.64","to do as we find people that god is "],["1534.96","working in um that we develop leaders "],["1538.88","that they can reach their people better "],["1540.72","than we can and so we do that in a "],["1543.039","number of different ways we do life "],["1544.96","leadership coaching "],["1547.039","we do we've done training missionaries "],["1550.48","and doing "],["1551.6","training pastors that kind of thing "],["1554.799","but and throughout all of our activities "],["1557.039","the main thing that we want to do is "],["1558.64","something called "],["1560.08","dmm is anyone familiar with dmm "],["1563.6","okay it stands for discipleship making "],["1565.36","movements "],["1566.559","and there's other forms of it i really "],["1569.2","like this one and it's really sweeping "],["1572.96","the world i think that i think that's "],["1574.72","not an overstatement "],["1576.72","it's it's in the states i know some "],["1578.24","churches that have really shifted their "],["1580.159","ministry toward this "],["1582.64","and it's it's really been effective in "],["1584.559","over 70 countries i believe "],["1586.799","and um and what it is is it's really "],["1589.2","getting people in the scriptures without "],["1590.799","a curriculum "],["1592.159","and getting them to to not just know "],["1594.559","something but to obey and so there's an "],["1598.159","opportunity to really learn and then "],["1600.4","interact with the scriptures right there "],["1602.4","in the small group so if you're someone "],["1604.32","who who has an evangelistic heart and or "],["1606.48","you connect easy with people "],["1608.48","this is a really good tool "],["1610.32","it's a really good tool if you just have "],["1611.84","people in your house a lot you can just "],["1614.32","it's a really easy way of just you know "],["1616.88","there's not a lot to memorize but you "],["1618.32","get a basic structure and you get people "],["1620.799","to read the scriptures together "],["1623.279","because east africa is a really communal "],["1625.52","environment "],["1627.2","and people are are often busy in some of "],["1629.44","the big cities people are able to do "],["1631.44","this while they're at work sometimes "],["1633.84","so we work sometimes with motorcycle and "],["1636.32","guys and as they're waiting for their "],["1638","next customer they'll sit and they'll "],["1639.919","read together and then "],["1641.84","but the thing that makes this "],["1643.76","important is that "],["1645.52","one way that we do it is we ask you okay "],["1647.52","what did you learn so read a passage "],["1649.6","maybe from the gospels or something what "],["1651.679","did you learn about god "],["1654.559","or what did you learn about jesus and "],["1656.08","then the second question would be what "],["1657.919","did you learn about yourself what did "],["1659.2","you learn about people what is god "],["1660.88","trying to tell us about people "],["1662.799","and then the third one is really "],["1664.159","important it's how are you going to obey "],["1666.08","this the truth that you learned in this "],["1667.52","passage "],["1668.48","this week "],["1669.6","and the idea is that that we would have "],["1671.84","a loving "],["1673.36","accountability not like hey i need you "],["1675.76","to do this it's more like hey i'm "],["1678.159","learning this about god i want to obey "],["1680.84","god and how can we help each other to do "],["1683.76","that "],["1684.64","and so that's kind of the goal so "],["1687.36","you know we get about 30 guys together "],["1689.44","every month and we get them and we train "],["1691.36","them we work with some other "],["1692.72","organizations some guys who are actually "],["1694.96","doing this already and we continue to "],["1697.12","give them training so if you could pray "],["1699.039","for that that that would continue to "],["1700.64","grow we'd appreciate that "],["1702.799","so we continue to be in contact with "],["1704.48","them even while we're gone "],["1706.32","and to encourage that to continue "],["1709.44","so but we incorporate the dmm into "],["1712.08","everything that we do "],["1714","so we do it even after soccer practice "],["1715.76","it's it's just essential to everything "],["1718.08","we do so they finish they finish at a "],["1720","certain time "],["1721.279","and then "],["1722.559","you know the coach will talk about the "],["1724.08","practice and then we'll go into "],["1726.08","uh the scripture and it's awesome to see "],["1727.76","the young men who are "],["1729.2","you know in that culture a lot of times "],["1730.559","they have to just do what they're told "],["1732","but they're we encourage them to stand "],["1733.919","up and to read the scripture "],["1735.679","and to talk about it and so it's really "],["1737.919","neat how we're able to to use that "],["1743.2","uh so for the life leadership coaching "],["1745.36","i'd like to share this with you and and "],["1747.6","and so i'm sharing this with you in a "],["1749.12","way "],["1749.84","um that that i hope just brings honor to "],["1752.559","god and and because you're partners with "],["1754.48","us and we want you to know some of the "],["1756.72","lives that have been impacted "],["1759.279","through the ministry and um "],["1762.159","and and so here's one example i asked "],["1764.799","two friends if they would just kind of "],["1766.72","give a brief testimony "],["1768.559","and here's a pastor friend of mine he's "],["1770.64","also an entrepreneur in east africa "],["1773.2","and as we did "],["1774.72","some life coaching together christian "],["1776.32","life coaching "],["1777.6","this is what he said "],["1779.2","i was in a place in life where i was "],["1780.72","experiencing turmoil which had a huge "],["1782.96","effect on my marriage ministry and "],["1784.559","business "],["1785.919","he actually hadn't taken a day off for "],["1787.6","years "],["1790.159","being a pastor where i was leading a "],["1791.6","local church and leading and demanding "],["1793.52","and growing business it was a real "],["1795.279","challenge to get myself to a place of "],["1796.96","health "],["1797.919","coaching counseling from chris not only "],["1799.6","helped me navigate a very turbulent "],["1801.279","season but it also helped me slow down "],["1803.36","and note areas i needed to focus on my "],["1805.36","character leadership "],["1806.96","relationships and most importantly my "],["1809.039","walk with god "],["1810.399","it has breathed life into my marriage "],["1812.24","and a healthier pace for my ministry and "],["1814.96","marketplace engagements "],["1817.52","i am truly grateful for the lifeline god "],["1819.84","extended to me through this journey "],["1824.159","so yeah this is "],["1826.24","a guy that we were able to get connected "],["1827.679","with and like i said was just kind of "],["1829.36","suffering from burnout had a lot of "],["1830.72","pressure expectations on him and so "],["1833.44","we're glad to walk with him for that "],["1835.039","time "],["1836.559","another example of leadership "],["1838.72","leadership coaching that we do "],["1840.96","so i mentioned to you earlier earlier "],["1843.2","evo and so you can get a better "],["1845.039","understanding of who he is just really "],["1847.76","down the earth guy so people call him m2 "],["1852.159","which means a man of the people so even "],["1854.24","though he's very well known "],["1855.919","he engages people easily "],["1858.32","and he cares about the community "],["1860.72","so eva was again he was a professional "],["1862.48","football player goalie in tanzania "],["1865.519","and this is what he said after we did "],["1866.96","coaching thank you so much for taking "],["1869.039","your time to be with me for the coaching "],["1871.679","for the for life coaching i learned much "],["1874.48","from watching your love for jesus "],["1876.72","and the kids and teaching them how to "],["1878.559","depend on god by reading the scriptures "],["1881.039","you also took the time to help me "],["1882.32","develop the evil mapunda sports center i "],["1884.799","know now how to raise support from "],["1886.24","people "],["1887.2","and org and organizations to lead the "],["1890.32","board of the club and to create a good "],["1891.919","business plan you walked with me to the "],["1894.24","point of of helping me reach my goals "],["1897.36","i'm now a certified coach with "],["1898.96","confederation of african football this "],["1901.279","is like the nfl for football in africa "],["1903.679","so he was able to get his certificate "],["1906.399","um "],["1908.96","traveling to other african nations as "],["1910.64","one of the under 17 national coaches i "],["1913.279","expect to get more coaching from you in "],["1915.2","the future so that i can learn more "],["1916.72","about god "],["1917.919","and make a greater impact in the world "],["1919.84","with the gifts that god has given me "],["1921.84","asante "],["1922.86","[Music]

needs "],["2040","that go towards a new car that we'll "],["2041.44","need at some point "],["2043.279","and just getting around and basic "],["2046.399","supplies so sometimes that means bibles "],["2048.96","sometimes that means just notepads for "],["2050.72","people "],["2052.159","things like that things that we would "],["2053.599","use "],["2054.399","to advance the kingdom there "],["2060.879","and yeah "],["2062.56","so uh that's just a little bit about us "],["2064.72","um "],["2065.919","of us living in east africa um it's been "],["2068.48","interesting i can tell you some stories "],["2070.48","about what it's like uh the last uh i "],["2074.159","guess year and a half two years since "],["2075.599","covid started "],["2076.96","um but really "],["2078.639","we shifted um to a relief at one point "],["2082.879","and what was really cool about that was "],["2084.56","seeing how people responded to the "],["2086.159","scriptures people were really hungry "],["2088.159","because there was all kind of rumors "],["2089.599","flying around "],["2091.2","just as there was here there was a lot "],["2092.879","of different stuff flying around there "],["2094.96","and i really feel like god used us and "],["2097.44","our our our leadership team our young "],["2099.76","guys "],["2100.64","to to preach the gospel so what we did "],["2102.64","was "],["2103.76","i believe i believe in some of you made "],["2105.839","donations for masks and soap and so we "],["2108.56","would do street preaching where we asked "],["2110.4","people to stay at a distance "],["2112.16","but we were able to give them education "],["2114.48","so we had a video in swahili we would "],["2116.24","show "],["2117.04","about what was going on and then we "],["2119.04","would be able to bless them with "],["2120.16","something that would help with the soap "],["2122","or masks but then also "],["2124.72","sometimes we'd come across somebody "],["2126.64","who's given away children's books so "],["2128.48","we'd be able to bless the kids with that "],["2130.88","but the exciting part of course was guys "],["2132.56","who had gone through the dmm being able "],["2134.88","to to do the street preaching for the "],["2136.48","first time or be able to share their "],["2138.24","testimony for the first time and so that "],["2140.88","was

need celebrate "],["71.04","recovery we want to talk about the first "],["73.439","part though because a lot of times we "],["75.68","focus on the recovery but remember "],["78.32","it's something to celebrate "],["80.799","it's not something to hide from it's not "],["82.72","something to be ashamed of "],["85.04","it's something to celebrate that god "],["87.84","wants to do this work in our life to "],["89.92","bring us to the point of recovery and "],["92.56","becoming more like jesus christ "],["95.36","if i could summarize what celebrate "],["97.84","recovery is "],["100.4","celebrate recovery "],["102.24","is an intense discipleship program "],["105.6","it teaches people that they need jesus "],["108","christ as their lord and savior that's "],["110.079","what separates us from "],["112.84","naa "],["114.799","s-a and all the other a's that are out "],["117.6","there "],["118.479","that's what separates us we are a "],["121.799","christ-centered recovery program "],["124.719","jesus christ is the star of this "],["127.68","recovery program no one else is "],["130.64","it takes a lot of us to run it but jesus "],["133.04","christ is the person behind it he is the "],["136.56","power behind it and he is the reason "],["139.84","for it so once you remember we want to "],["142.64","celebrate recovery and in it we're "],["145.12","celebrating jesus christ and who he is "],["147.84","and what he's done "],["149.68","so "],["151.599","let's talk a little bit more about this "],["153.28","next slide "],["154.84","please what we are at celebrate recovery "],["159.36","we're a safe place to share "],["161.92","a place of belonging "],["163.84","a place to care for others and to be "],["165.84","cared for "],["167.68","sounds like it's a church almost right a "],["170.48","place where respect is given for each "],["172.959","member "],["173.92","a place where confidentiality is highly "],["176.72","regarded "],["178.08","a place to learn a place to grow and "],["180.64","become strong again a place where you "],["182.959","can take off your mask a place for "],["185.599","healthy challenges and healthy risk "],["189.519","a turning point in your life "],["193.44","what we are not "],["195.68","we're not a place for selfish control "],["198.159","the goal of celebrate recovery is for "],["200","you to come in and tell everybody else "],["201.84","how to do their life "],["203.36","that's not what the point is and the "],["205.68","point is not for us to tell you how to "],["208.08","direct your life but let jesus christ "],["210.4","become the director of your life "],["212.4","it's not a place for therapy we're "],["214.239","fortunate to be in a church that has "],["216.56","therapy programs available "],["219.12","if you want to know more about that just "],["220.72","call the church office they'd be glad to "],["222.239","help you and we have that we're not a "],["225.36","place to look for dating relationships "],["229.76","especially if you're married coming to "],["231.28","celebrate recovery that's true "],["234.799","so you don't want that to happen "],["237.519","we're "],["238.56","not a place to rescue or be rescued by "],["241.439","others as a co-dependent i want to "],["243.92","rescue people because i want men to like "],["246.56","me "],["247.519","well i want you to love me "],["250.08","and if i do something for you then "],["251.519","you'll love me right that's one of my "],["253.12","codependency issues i want to be your "],["255.519","savior "],["256.479","there's only one savior that is jesus "],["258.639","christ it's not our job to fix other "],["262","people "],["263.52","and it's not your job to come in to "],["265.36","celebrate recovery and fix others so "],["267.44","that takes a big burden off your "],["268.72","shoulders right you don't have to come "],["270.479","in and "],["271.36","figure out everybody's issues "],["273.44","it's not a place for perfection "],["277.919","it's not a place to judge others "],["280.639","it's not a place for political "],["282.24","discussions we have a class on that on "],["284.32","sunday mornings at nine o'clock "],["286.32","um "],["287.44","and it's not a place for a quick fix "],["290.08","you see recovery "],["293.04","is not something that takes place "],["294.8","overnight because just as becoming a "],["297.44","follower of jesus christ "],["299.52","to become more like christ takes "],["302","time "],["303.28","matter of fact it takes until we are "],["305.44","dead and see jesus face to face "],["308.4","recovery is a process "],["311.52","and one of the great things about "],["313.36","celebrate recovery is you can learn the "],["315.36","discipleship process of what it means to "],["317.52","be a follower of jesus "],["319.6","from salvation all the way to what it "],["321.84","looks like to be a mature believer and "],["324.08","how to keep working on that because it "],["327.759","never ends "],["329.84","so even if you never want to step door "],["333.36","in "],["334","into a celebrate recovery because you "],["335.759","have no issues "],["339.199","you should come and learn how to be a "],["340.88","fully devoted follower of jesus christ "],["342.96","it's just a great way to learn and the "],["344.8","step studies that we're going to be "],["346.08","offering men beginning october 3rd and "],["348.72","the ladies beginning november 3rd it "],["351.039","goes through "],["352.4","every part of these principles and helps "],["354.56","you learn how to be a fully devoted "],["356.4","follower jesus christ and we'll talk "],["358.479","about some things today that you'll do "],["360.4","in those step studies that most "],["362.639","christians like to skip "],["366.24","and when they skip it they leave their "],["368.4","life short of what god wants it to be "],["371.36","so "],["373.36","whoo with that "],["375.039","who you see here what you say here stays "],["377.44","here "],["378.479","here here anonymity and confidentiality "],["381.039","are key to celebrate recovery so we had "],["384.319","a video with somebody in it in the first "],["386.16","service that we're not going to show in "],["387.84","a second service because "],["391.12","they don't want it on the internet "],["393.039","and that is part of who we are we "],["394.88","respect one another's an amenity and "],["397.88","confidentiality it's vital it's "],["400.24","important but we do have a couple videos "],["402.4","we want to show here a couple quick "],["404.08","testimonials so mike hi everyone my name "],["407.44","is amanda and i am a grateful believer "],["410","in jesus christ who struggles with "],["412","perfectionism and self-worth and i have "],["414.639","10 months of victory over alcohol abuse "],["417.759","i started attending celebrate recovery "],["419.84","in may of last year when i was still "],["421.68","living in north carolina "],["423.84","i had been listening to face livestreams "],["425.84","for a few months at that point and "],["427.68","having recommitted my life to christ "],["429.52","during that time i was really looking "],["431.44","for a sense of community to talk through "],["433.36","some of the issues i was battling and "],["435.199","trying to work through "],["437.12","i listened to a message recently from a "],["439.12","speaker at a cr conference and they "],["441.039","describe perfectionism as a person "],["443.36","fighting to keep a beach ball underneath "],["445.36","the water "],["446.319","you keep fighting and fighting to keep "],["448.16","the beach ball down so you can keep "],["449.919","everything hidden beneath the surface "],["452","and it's exhausting "],["453.84","so from what you see on the surface "],["455.759","everything seems perfect i've got a "],["457.84","great family i'm smart i'm athletic i'm "],["460.24","on top of things i'm getting promotions "],["462.319","at work and on and on it goes "],["465.28","in that same message they discussed how "],["467.52","other issues are often much easier to "],["469.52","spot and call out as bad so it's like "],["472.479","drug addiction that's bad "],["474.8","pornography that's bad perfectionism hey "],["478.479","can you help me with this "],["480.879","it can be much harder to realize and "],["482.8","acknowledge the very real issues that "],["484.8","are happening beneath the surface "],["487.12","for me one of the things i've always "],["489.039","struggled with are overwhelming thoughts "],["491.28","and emotions of worthlessness "],["493.36","i find myself constantly battling this "],["495.599","feeling of being on the outside looking "],["497.84","in and just wanting people to like me "],["501.039","very early in my life my self-worth "],["503.199","became rooted in what others thought of "],["505.039","me and was only as strong as the praise "],["507.44","and affirmations that i received "],["509.919","i quickly realized that being the best "],["512.159","and striving for perfection was the best "],["514.32","way to get those affirmations "],["516.399","as i grew older and my family moved out "],["518.64","of state i began chasing love and "],["520.56","admiration however i could find it i "],["523.12","found myself in social circles that led "],["525.04","me down destructive fast and i quickly "],["527.279","lost my sense of self "],["530","hurts from failed dating relationships "],["531.92","continued to magnify my inner dialogue "],["534.24","of doubt and my anxieties about being "],["536.399","perfect and i began using alcohol to "],["538.72","mask those hurts "],["540.399","as my alcohol use increased things "],["542.48","continued to spiral further and further "],["544.48","beyond my control until i finally "],["546.48","reached the point of realizing that i "],["548.24","needed a change "],["549.6","it would be several years from the point "],["551.36","of wanting to change my behavior before "],["553.44","i realized what it was i was missing "],["556.56","after making the decision to turn my "],["558.48","life over to christ in march of 2020 i "],["561.44","started the journey of digging through "],["563.04","my hurts and trying to understand where "],["565.12","all this pain and feelings of "],["566.72","worthlessness comes from and celebrate "],["568.88","recovery gives me the space and support "],["570.8","to do that "],["571.92","the steps and principles i've learned "],["573.6","have given me the tools i need to work "],["575.44","on surrendering control to christ daily "],["577.76","and the fellowship of women i've found "],["579.519","lets me be open about the issues i'm "],["581.44","facing in a safe environment rather than "],["584","constantly fighting to keep that beach "],["585.76","ball hidden beneath the surface "],["588.08","participating in a step study is what "],["590.08","really took things to an even deeper "],["592","level of understanding and growth for me "],["594.64","the only thing i knew about step studies "],["596.48","before i started was that someone told "],["598.399","me it completely changed her life "],["600.64","i moved here in october of last year and "],["603.12","the step study started that same week "],["605.36","which we all know was definitely not a "],["607.68","coincidence "],["609.519","our small group of ladies met every "],["611.36","wednesday for about six months and we "],["613.76","spent each week learning more about the "],["615.76","12 steps and peeling back the layers of "],["618","our hurts hang-ups and habits "],["620.56","i'll forever be bonded with the women i "],["622.56","shared that experience with and "],["624.72","i'm really looking forward to having the "],["626.32","opportunity to lead our

"],["1109.36","imagine that if you're here "],["1112.32","you're at least inquisitive if god is "],["1114.24","real or not "],["1116.24","he is real "],["1117.76","he is the creator and sustainer of

treats us with dignity "],["1249.36","and one of the huge things we have to "],["1250.96","realize "],["1252","is that god has given this choice to "],["1254.64","trust him and follow him or not "],["1259.679","when anybody is trying to manipulate "],["1262.559","you to do something "],["1265.76","that's not healthy "],["1268.559","and god is not a manipulator "],["1272.159","god invites us

us to choose "],["1326.88","but "],["1327.6","we kind of miss some of this though i "],["1330.24","think a lot of us when i was "],["1333.039","16 there and i chose to commit my life "],["1336.08","to christ did you catch that i chose to "],["1338.4","commit "],["1340.08","my life to christ what word did i leave "],["1342","out "],["1345.36","that's when it gets a little harder "],["1347.12","right "],["1348.32","that's when the robber really begins to "],["1350.48","meet the road in christianity it's not "],["1352.799","just trusting him to save me it's "],["1354.96","trusting him with every part "],["1358.159","of my life "],["1360.72","all of my life and "],["1364.64","will "],["1366.48","to christ's care and control next "],["1368.88","principle please "],["1371.38","[Laughter]

"],["1430.64","uh "],["1431.6","see this is what a lot of times is left "],["1433.84","out of discipleship programs it's like "],["1436.24","oh yeah confess your sins but they "],["1437.76","really don't go okay "],["1440.32","let's write them all out "],["1444.88","i don't want to do that yeah well "],["1448.48","and for years "],["1450","i "],["1450.72","i've been part of celebrate recovery "],["1453.039","since almost the very beginning in ways "],["1456.159","but this part "],["1459.2","until about a year and a half ago i was "],["1461.36","doing ishish "],["1464.159","what do you mean ish "],["1465.84","i was openly "],["1468.96","examining confessing "],["1471.12","most "],["1473.84","of my faults "],["1476.48","most of my sins "],["1478.88","there was a few things in my past i just "],["1481.039","wanted to "],["1483.76","leave out you know well can i just "],["1486.32","forget them and put them behind me and "],["1488.08","they won't affect me "],["1491.12","no "],["1492.32","i'm going to share something in a little "],["1493.84","bit "],["1495.36","that i think "],["1497.76","when a major habit starts in your life "],["1499.679","or a major hurt "],["1501.919","happens in your life or when you cause a "],["1504","major hurt "],["1505.44","and it's not resolved you get stuck at "],["1507.84","that age "],["1511.12","but openly examine and confess my faults "],["1514.32","to myself to god and to someone i trust "],["1518.48","why should we confess to ourselves "],["1520.48","because sometimes we just need to be "],["1522.64","honest with "],["1525.2","us "],["1530.72","and that can be really hard "],["1532.64","that's why we need people to walk "],["1534.32","alongside of us to encourage us in this "],["1537.2","and then we need to confess it to god "],["1540.159","now god already knows everything so it's "],["1542.24","not like you're going to go god's going "],["1543.76","to be embarrassed by what you've done oh "],["1545.52","man i can't believe you did that steve "],["1547.52","he already knows "],["1549.44","before time began he knew what you were "],["1552.08","going to do so it's not like a shock to "],["1554.24","him "],["1555.52","and to confess to someone else why we "],["1558.24","are to confess our false once another so "],["1560.64","that we might be healed that's what it "],["1562.799","tells us in james "],["1566","we're to confess our faults one to "],["1567.44","another why because what is in secret "],["1570.64","keeps us sick "],["1574.64","what we keep secret keeps us sick and "],["1577.2","god doesn't want us sick he wants us "],["1579.919","well and when we expose our sins to the "],["1583.52","light they lose the power over us "],["1588.72","one of the great things we've been "],["1589.84","learning in celebrate recovery working "],["1591.919","with other people "],["1593.2","is even with temptation when people are "],["1595.84","honest about temptation all sudden the "],["1598.159","temptation isn't as powerful "],["1601.2","because it's in the light "],["1604.4","and once it's in the light it's like oh "],["1606.08","well everybody knows that i might be "],["1607.44","struggling with this so now "],["1610.4","it's not it's powerful "],["1613.2","and that's how god wants us to live and "],["1615.44","then that leads us to the next one we "],["1617.12","can't do issues "],["1622.08","read it with me please voluntarily "],["1624.32","submit to any and all changes god wants "],["1627.84","to make in my life and humbly ask them "],["1630.4","to remove my character defects "],["1633.039","happy are those whose greatest desire is "],["1635.279","to do what god requires "],["1638.08","voluntarily submit again god doesn't "],["1643.44","force us "],["1645.919","god's not a manipulator god is not an "],["1648.64","abuser "],["1651.76","he brings us to this point and he gives "],["1653.6","us a choice and he asks us to "],["1655.84","voluntarily submit "],["1658.799","to any and all "],["1660.96","changes can you say those two were those "],["1663.2","three words any and all any and all one "],["1666.159","more time any and all "],["1670","that can be quite scary can it "],["1672.48","especially if you don't believe god "],["1674.159","loves you "],["1675.6","if you don't believe he has the power to "],["1677.44","help you "],["1678.48","and if you don't believe that "],["1680.72","he cares "],["1682.96","but when you realize he loves you that "],["1684.64","he cares and he has the power to help "],["1686.08","you then it becomes easier to give "],["1688.88","any and all changes to god "],["1691.84","any and all "],["1693.6","now "],["1695.279","you can say this but it's actually a lot "],["1697.919","harder to live out isn't it this is "],["1700.08","again one of those things you can't do "],["1701.76","ishish "],["1702.799","god i give you everything but "],["1708.08","i give you everything but that hurt i "],["1710.08","give you everything but that sin i give "],["1712.559","you everything but that habit "],["1716.799","or have you ever been to a church "],["1718.159","service and god really convicted you "],["1720","about something and you said "],["1724.159","and he left and did nothing about it "],["1729.36","you missed out on what god wants to do "],["1731.44","in your life "],["1733.76","you see god loves you so much that he "],["1736.159","died for you rose again for you and "],["1738.48","wants to conform you to the image of "],["1740.72","jesus christ "],["1742.799","he began this good work as faithful to "],["1744.799","complete it to the day of christ it's "],["1746.399","this tremendous process but it gets "],["1749.52","accelerated when we voluntarily submit "],["1752.799","to any and all changes that god wants to "],["1756.96","make "],["1758.64","so when you write down that inventory "],["1761.12","of all your faults "],["1763.36","you might see some things that god wants "],["1765.44","to "],["1769.44","and what celebrate recovery does it "],["1771.44","walks alongside of you with other "],["1773.12","brothers and sisters and say hey let's "],["1775.039","make these "],["1776.799","changes "],["1778.799","let's do this "],["1780.399","together "],["1782.32","next one please "],["1784.48","please read this with me out loud "],["1786.88","evaluate all my relationships offer "],["1789.76","forgiveness to those who have hurt me "],["1791.919","and make amends for harm i've done to "],["1794","others when possible "],["1795.6","except when to do so would harm them or "],["1797.76","others "],["1798.64","happy are the merciful happy are the "],["1801.6","peacemakers "],["1804.32","evaluate all my relationships "],["1809.76","all of them "],["1810.88","yeah what about the ones with people who "],["1813.36","are jerks "],["1818.08","yup "],["1820.24","what about the ones i haven't talked to "],["1821.76","in 20 years "],["1824","oh yep "],["1826.08","what about the ones that just tick me "],["1828.799","off "],["1830.08","yup "],["1831.919","what about the ones i'm afraid of "],["1840.48","all right "],["1841.84","open honesty right forgot to mention "],["1844.159","this in the first service but one of the "],["1846.08","reasons why i didn't openly

"],["1903.279","experienced or started around that time "],["1910.399","and you haven't matured past it "],["1913.44","because you haven't dealt with it "],["1918.24","god wants you to recover fully

"],["2200.56","about how to recover and become a "],["2202.4","disciple of jesus christ "],["2205.359","but if all you do is hoard it to "],["2206.96","yourself "],["2208","you're really not a

jesus christ "],["2223.839","because you're not obeying jesus christ "],["2225.68","yet "],["2229.52","and so what celebrate recovery is "],["2232.88","it is a christ-centered recovery program "],["2238.8","but really what it is "],["2241.04","it is a christ-centered discipleship "],["2243.92","program "],["2245.119","to help any person "],["2247.119","who's ever been hurt "],["2250.32","or has hurt others "],["2252.24","so i guess that would be about everybody "],["2253.92","in here then right "],["2255.599","because if you haven't been hurt "],["2258.4","which i find that hard to believe "],["2259.76","because if you're alive you've been hurt "],["2261.119","by people "],["2262.64","or you've hurt others "],["2265.44","you need to figure out how to deal with "],["2267.76","it

"],["2309.599","you're like why do i always react so "],["2311.52","poorly with this person "],["2313.92","you got some hang up that you're not "],["2315.76","dealing with "],["2317.04","that you need to deal with "],["2319.92","it's just "],["2321.2","i wrote my journal this morning "],["2324.96","why when my wife asked me to move a bush "],["2328.96","do i always begrudgingly help "],["2334.24","i never help with a happy heart "],["2338.96","never "],["2340.8","why is that "],["2342","i don't know yet that's one of the areas "],["2344.16","i'm growing in "],["2345.92","but it's something why we we have to do "],["2347.68","that we got we react these certain ways "],["2349.599","we need to figure out why and part of "],["2351.359","this recovery program will help us do "],["2353.68","that "],["2354.64","and then we also have the fact "],["2358.16","with habits "],["2360.16","if we're doing something we know we "],["2361.76","shouldn't do or doing something we don't "],["2363.68","want to do anymore "],["2365.92","we need to figure out how to get over "],["2367.599","that christ wants to help us to recover "],["2370.56","he has the power to do that "],["2372.88","you see in one of the biggest "],["2374.16","differences between a recovery program "],["2377.2","that's christ centered and just a "],["2379.92","rehabilitation program "],["2382.4","is rehabilitation can help you stop "],["2384.8","doing something "],["2386.32","but usually you end up replacing it "],["2390.24","one of the most fascinating things is if "],["2392.079","you go to an aaa meeting how much sugar "],["2394.8","they will eat "],["2397.119","why because you're transferring one "],["2399.2","dopamine hit for a "],["2404.48","when i would

"],["146.64","a little more sober but something we "],["148.72","have to do so psalm 127 "],["152.08","a song of a sense of solomon "],["155.2","beginning in verse 1 it reads unless the "],["158.16","lord builds the house "],["160.08","the builders labor in vain unless the "],["162.959","lord watches over the city "],["165.28","the guards stand watch in vain in vain "],["168.239","you rise early "],["169.519","and stay up late toiling for food to eat "],["172.239","for he grants sleep "],["174","to those he loves children are a "],["176.72","heritage from the

is full "],["188.159","of them they will not be put to shame "],["190.4","when they contend with their opponents "],["192.959","in court "],["194.239","so let's pray before we dive in father "],["198.239","god i thank you "],["199.68","for your word i thank you for the truth "],["201.92","contained "],["203.36","in this passage that we're looking at i "],["204.959","pray god that your spirit would be among "],["206.56","us god that you would be "],["208.64","present in our midst as we learn and "],["211.44","guys we consider "],["214.159","are the efforts we're doing is this are "],["216.159","you in them god are you bl are you "],["218.159","building the house "],["219.84","that we're building are you about the "],["221.76","work that we're about "],["223.36","god give us

that you've designed for them "],["237.519","jesus name we pray amen so verse 1 "],["241.36","unless the lord builds the house "],["244.959","they labor in vain who build it "],["248.56","so in this passage we see a couple very "],["251.28","fundamental "],["252.48","human endeavors human works "],["256.239","that are recorded here we see the "],["257.759","building of houses in verse 1. "],["260.799","we see the watching of cities the "],["263.36","defending of what we've built "],["265.52","and in verse 2 we see the need for "],["267.759","toiling "],["268.96","and for working to provide for those "],["271.84","things that we've built "],["273.12","these are basic activities that every "],["275.44","nation around the world "],["276.8","throughout all of human history "],["277.919","basically understands these things "],["281.04","building houses there's always activity "],["283.52","there's people "],["284.24","men are always doing things and "],["286.08","contributing to something that is bigger "],["287.6","than them "],["290.08","we labor to make things we make not just "],["292.8","houses but we make "],["293.919","cities and we make governments so we "],["296.56","make institutions we build "],["298.479","wherever we go but it's not enough just "],["301.28","to build "],["302.24","something we also have to protect it "],["304.96","once it's "],["305.6","once it's built lest somebody should "],["307.28","come in and destroy or take "],["310.08","and steal what we've labored so hard to "],["312.639","make because building "],["314.16","is a long term effort it takes time "],["317.28","takes work as precious when we've built "],["319.52","something we don't want someone "],["321.039","someone to just snatch it from us "],["324.479","but it's not enough just to build or "],["326.88","protect we also need to "],["328.479","sustain right we have kids and we have "],["331.36","to feed them we have to "],["332.8","give them uh warm air in the winter time "],["336.08","and then "],["336.639","cold air in the summertime right we need "],["338.16","to keep them alive "],["339.84","and and give them give them these basic "],["342","human needs "],["344.16","so psalm 127 understands these very "],["346.56","basic things these necessities "],["348.24","for human uh human civilization human "],["351.199","life "],["352.24","but it says that unless the lord is the "],["354.4","one working in them "],["356.56","unless he is the one establishing them "],["359.039","our efforts "],["360.639","are in vain it is in vain that people "],["363.199","guard the city "],["364.4","unless the lord is watching over it we "],["367.12","know people "],["368.08","um in our own lives who who wake up "],["370","early and they are super "],["371.68","career focused and everything is work "],["373.6","and work and work "],["375.12","there's no rest and there's no peace to "],["378.16","be found in just toil "],["379.52","peace and rest comes from god and he "],["381.68","gives it to those "],["382.639","he loves i think it's very natural for "],["385.919","us to

"],["394.4","we've done "],["395.919","but according to psalm 127 "],["398.96","apart from god's laboring our labors are "],["402.08","pointless "],["403.199","they contribute nothing this speaks to

he "],["425.12","doesn't just establish them "],["426.479","he also gives meaning he keeps "],["429.52","them from becoming vain and meaningless "],["434.96","have a question how many of you would "],["437.039","consider yourself to be "],["439.12","um a history buff or someone who enjoys "],["443.199","reading about history we got michelle we "],["446.16","got a couple of you guys

"],["474.319","most significant lives i'm thinking "],["476.08","about somebody like "],["476.96","winston churchill or abraham lincoln "],["479.759","these guys who are momentous "],["481.599","in

"],["492.56","when when i read a book like that and "],["494.24","it's awesome and you get to the end "],["497.599","you get this sense of sadness what i "],["500.639","mean "],["500.96","it's it's their life this this life that "],["503.12","was characterized with all this energy "],["504.72","and all this intelligence and all these "],["506.96","great deeds it's now coming to a close "],["508.879","and "],["509.199","and they're they're losing their mind "],["511.599","right they're losing that energy and "],["512.959","that and that passion "],["515.44","and then they're that

that we entrust with our legacy "],["913.76","having children is perhaps even more "],["915.44","fundamental than building houses or "],["917.12","protecting cities these other things

this truth "],["928.48","that it is god who gives "],["931.6","children and we need god's power for "],["934.079","even the most basic "],["935.44","human endeavor the building of a family "],["939.04","so verse 3 says this children are a "],["941.12","heritage from the lord "],["942.959","the fruit of the womb a reward "],["946.079","so these little ones are gifts from god

"],["973.279","inheritance from god "],["976.16","i think this this passage describes "],["979.759","children in such an interesting way "],["982.959","i was thinking a lot about it this week "],["984.48","that he says like arrows in the hand of "],["986.32","a warrior "],["987.68","are the children of a man's youth i "],["990.24","think of all the things you could "],["991.839","use to

you understand a little bit that "],["1000.32","their boys are kind of ranged weaponry "],["1003.12","that wreak damage um "],["1006.639","so it kind of makes sense if you have "],["1007.839","sons but i want you to consider this "],["1010.8","quote "],["1012","i heard this um several years ago "],["1015.04","at marriage conference you guys had "],["1018.24","mom and dad and it just this quote

really "],["146.08","uh remarkable not for god it's not "],["148.959","remarkable but just "],["150.56","for missionaries in general and faith "],["153.84","bible was one of our "],["155.84","supporting churches from the beginning i "],["157.68","think 2002 "],["160.4","and you all have been faithful prayer "],["163.28","and financial supporters since that time "],["165.84","and for that we are truly thankful "],["168.959","with that in mind we went to quebec city "],["171.2","canada "],["172.319","to learn french because the "],["176.16","governmental operational language in "],["179.36","togo is french "],["180.48","because the french used to rule togo but "],["183.76","everybody has "],["185.04","a mother tongue everybody has a tribal "],["188.56","language "],["190.08","or a tribal dialect and with that in "],["193.519","mind "],["194.959","you don't learn french unless you go to "],["196.72","school well literacy "],["198.08","rate is only 50 percent in togo "],["201.76","therefore only 50 percent of people know "],["204.08","french "],["205.28","therefore i had to have a translator for "],["207.44","half the patients i saw "],["209.519","so for the 50 i could talk to but "],["212.799","the others i needed a translator which "],["215.68","was "],["216","i actually just a side note was good "],["218.72","because "],["219.76","when you start we try to share the "],["221.28","gospel with everybody we see "],["223.84","but when you want to talk about "],["226.239","spiritual matters "],["228.56","you want to go to their mother tongue "],["230.56","and so it was good to have a translator "],["232.159","that who could then connect with them "],["234.64","in their mother tongue so they could "],["237.2","learn about the good news of jesus "],["238.879","christ "],["239.68","sheryl and i go sheryl and i got over to "],["243.36","uh august i mean to togo in august of "],["247.56","2004 "],["248.72","where we have been since then "],["252","i'm a medical care provider but also "],["256.4","as time went on i became chief of staff "],["258.88","and now medical director "],["261.84","we are now on furlough which is not "],["264.08","vacation by the way "],["265.84","and uh we're a home home assignment and "],["268.72","that's going to end "],["269.84","at the end of june but the mission "],["273.28","agency "],["273.919","and the hospital have asked me if we "],["276.24","would stay here for two extra years "],["278.479","stateside because a hospital "],["282.56","which was built in 1985 "],["286.32","is now 36 years old and it's starting to "],["288.72","show its age like some of us "],["291.759","and with that in mind we feel that we "],["294.96","need to upgrade the hospital "],["297.04","and we also feel that we need to expand "],["299.6","the hospital because "],["300.96","some there sometimes we can't see 50 "],["304","of the patients who would like to come "],["305.52","to our hospital because of lack of "],["307.44","facilities "],["308.88","so we are going to be going through what "],["310.96","we call a "],["312.24","vision project which is going to do "],["314.16","upgrades and also expansion of the "],["316.8","hospital "],["318.16","from 50 beds to anywhere from 90 to 100 "],["320.72","beds "],["321.84","and as i will say during my message "],["325.919","it also includes taking into training "],["329.52","uh and toggle these brothers and sisters "],["332","to do the healthcare provision there as "],["334","well as spiritual "],["335.84","so uh we are here for that and they've "],["338","asked us if we would stay for these next "],["339.84","two years so that i could "],["341.28","be the ambassador for the vision project "],["344.639","and help fundraise but more importantly "],["348.72","to recruit god own "],["352.4","i don't have any doubt about financial "],["354.32","god owns a cattle on a thousand hills "],["356.16","and as somebody told me a "],["358.16","few months ago he owns the hills as well "],["361.28","so the financial support is going to be "],["365.759","there "],["366.08","it may part of that hopefully will come "],["368.08","from a faith bible "],["369.6","but he knows who is going to who is "],["372.72","going to help "],["373.44","uh fund this project

"],["611.92","to the lost souls which god seeks and "],["614.88","when they come to him "],["616.24","the rejoicing that that you hear in "],["618.399","heaven "],["620.8","luke chapter 15 the parable of the lost "],["623.2","sheep "],["623.839","now the tax collectors and sinners were "],["625.839","all drawing near to him "],["627.839","and the pharisees and the scribes "],["629.36","grumbled saying this man received "],["631.2","sinners he needs "],["632","with them so he told them this parable "],["634.959","what man of you "],["636.16","having a hundred sheep if he has lost "],["638","one of them does not leave the 99 in the "],["640.16","open country "],["641.36","and go after the one that is lost until "],["643.36","he finds it "],["644.56","and when he has found it he lays it on "],["646.48","his shoulders rejoicing and when he "],["648.079","comes home he calls together his friends "],["650.24","and his neighbors saying to them "],["652.079","rejoice with me for i

"],["663.2","righteous persons "],["664.72","who need no repentance then the second "],["667.279","parable is the parable of the lost coin "],["669.92","of what or what woman having ten silver "],["672.32","coins if she loses one coin "],["674.079","does not light a lamp and sweep the "],["676","house and seek diligently until she "],["678.48","finds it "],["679.279","and when she has found

"],["688.56","the angels of god "],["690.24","over one sinner who repent and finally "],["693.36","the parable of the prodigal son "],["696.399","and he said there was a man who had two "],["698.48","sons and the younger of them said to his "],["700.32","father father give me the share of "],["702.48","property that is coming to me and he "],["704.959","divided his property between them "],["707.12","not many days later the younger son "],["709.04","gathered all he had "],["710.72","and took a journey into a foreign "],["712.48","country and there he squandered his "],["714.399","property "],["715.04","and reckless living and when he had "],["717.519","spent everything a severe famine arose "],["719.839","in that country and he began to be in "],["721.44","need "],["722.399","so he went and hired himself out to one "],["724.48","of the citizens of the country who sent "],["726.32","him into his fields to feed pigs "],["729.36","and he was longing to be fed with the "],["731.36","pods that the pigs ate "],["733.279","and no one gave him anything but when he "],["735.92","came to himself he said how many of my "],["738","father's hired servants "],["739.76","have more than enough bread but i perish "],["742.959","here "],["743.6","more but i perish with hunger "],["746.72","i will arise and go to my father and i "],["748.56","will say to him

"],["758.24","and he arose and came to his father "],["760.16","and while he was still a long way off "],["762.88","his father saw him and felt compassion "],["765.279","and ran and embraced him and kissed him "],["768.24","and the son said to him father i have "],["769.839","sinned against heaven and before you i "],["771.6","am no longer "],["772.399","worthy to be called your son but the "],["774.639","father said to his servants bring "],["776.079","quickly the best robe and put it on him "],["778","and put a ring on his hand "],["779.68","and shoes on his feet and bring the "],["781.68","fattened calf and kill it "],["783.36","and let us eat and celebrate for this my "],["785.519","son was dead "],["786.72","and is alive again he was lost and is "],["788.88","found "],["789.76","and they began to celebrate now his "],["792.32","older son was in the "],["793.839","field and as he came and drew near to "],["795.839","the house he certain "],["796.959","he heard music and dancing and he called "],["798.88","one of the servants and asked what these "],["800.48","things meant "],["801.839","and he said to him your brother has come "],["804.56","and your father has killed the fattened "],["806","calf because he has received him back "],["807.92","safe and sound "],["809.6","but he was angry and refused to go in "],["811.92","his father came "],["812.8","out and treated him but he answered his "],["815.279","father "],["815.92","look these many years i have served you "],["820.399","and i never disobeyed your command yet "],["822.959","you never gave me a "],["824.399","young goat that i might celebrate with "],["826.48","my friends "],["827.6","but when his son of when this son of "],["829.92","yours came "],["831.36","who has devoured your property with "],["832.959","prostitutes you killed the fattened calf "],["834.88","for him "],["836.16","and he said to him son you are always "],["838.399","with me "],["839.279","and all that is mine is yours it is "],["841.6","fitting to celebrate the glad "],["844.88","these to celebrate and be glad for this "],["847.04","your brother was dead "],["848.24","and is alive he was lost and is found "],["851.44","amen now there's a whole "],["855.04","another lesson on the prodigal son's "],["859.12","brother okay that's a whole different uh "],["862.24","subject but uh we're gonna "],["863.92","stick with these parables now now what "],["866.32","you see "],["868.16","it was interesting you start with how "],["869.6","many sheep "],["871.519","100 sheep how many coins how many "],["874.959","how many uh souls one "],["878","all of them point to the one that was "],["880.32","lost "],["881.199","okay and uh and that's so important "],["884.88","now what it also shows is the fact as in "],["887.839","christianity "],["889.12","we have a god that seeks us and as far "],["891.44","as i know we're the only religion "],["893.279","where god actually seeks his followers "],["896.839","okay and in these parables "],["899.68","it's always either the owner of the "],["902.56","sheep "],["903.279","the owner of the coin or the father "],["906.48","who runs after and seeks "],["909.68","what was lost notice the father prodigal "],["913.04","son he "],["913.68","ran after him and god does the same "],["917.04","thing "],["917.519","for us each and every one of us "],["920.88","next slide god has always been in the "],["924.079","process of seeking us "],["926","he created us for his own pleasure "],["929.6","he knew he he was there from the first "],["932.24","time we sinned in the garden of eden "],["934.24","and he provided a pathway to forgiveness "],["936.8","and everlasting life "],["938.079","you can see that in genesis chapter 3. "],["942.079","he also provided us with a lot of "],["945.04","guidelines "],["945.839","if you look back in the old testament "],["947.519","the ten commandments "],["949.759","and then jesus narrowed it down to two "],["951.68","greatest commandments love the lord your "],["953.44","god with all your heart mind soul and "],["955.199","strength "],["956.079","which covers the first four commandments "],["959.04","in a vertical relationship with "],["961.12","our father a heavenly father and then "],["965.04","love your neighbor as yourself which "],["967.279","covers the last six commandments which "],["969.519","is our horizontal "],["970.88","relationship with our brothers and "],["972.48","sisters so we have a vertical "],["974.24","relationship with god "],["976","horizontal relationship with our "],["978.32","brothers and sisters you put those "],["979.759","together "],["980.56","and you got the cross of christ that's "],["983.519","my thoughts "],["985.12","and uh but ultimately god sent "],["988.16","his own son down on earth "],["993.199","to pay the price to buy us back "],["996.48","from satan he went "],["999.759","he died he was crucified dead and buried "],["1003.839","he was killed for our iniquities our "],["1006.32","trespasses our sins "],["1007.839","past and present but he was raised from "],["1010.959","the dead "],["1012","overcoming death satan and the power of "],["1014.16","sin "],["1015.12","and moving us into justification through "],["1017.68","his righteousness he "],["1019.04","clothed us with his righteousness so "],["1021.6","when god sees us he doesn't see "],["1023.68","our sinful nature he sees christ and "],["1026.559","what a blessing that is a "],["1028.64","unbelievable gift "],["1031.839","and then he continues to seek us each "],["1034.559","and every day "],["1036.24","now again when christ "],["1039.919","when christ came and saved us he not "],["1042.72","only "],["1043.679","uh saved us from our sin but he saved us "],["1047.76","into newness of life i think we as "],["1050.72","christians forget about that "],["1052.24","we appreciate salvation "],["1056.08","we appreciate having a having a free "],["1058.72","ticket "],["1059.36","to go to heaven but i think we forget "],["1062.08","that the scripture always says "],["1063.679","also says into newness of life you can "],["1066.24","read that in "],["1067.12","romans chapter six and we forget that we "],["1070.799","need to live "],["1072.24","for christ we need to be a great "],["1073.919","testimony "],["1075.44","as one of the songs said "],["1078.48","that that he only not only makes us new "],["1081.76","on the inside "],["1083.36","but he wants us to cry out and make "],["1085.52","newness on the outside too "],["1087.28","when he's a church but he's individuals "],["1089.919","whether it be "],["1090.88","sundays but again we live christianity "],["1094.32","is 24 "],["1095.039","7. i didn't learn that until later in "],["1097.36","life "],["1098.32","and we need to live that whether it be "],["1100.24","at school whether it be at work whether

"],["1127.2","to buy us back from that he came and he "],["1130.24","found cheryl and myself "],["1132.08","he brought us along and through his "],["1135.679","steadfast love and faithfulness he "],["1137.84","brought us step by step "],["1139.679","until the time he thought was right for "],["1142.24","us to go to the mission field "],["1144.96","and we stepped out in faith because we "],["1148.32","believe in the one true god we took a "],["1151.52","biblical "],["1152.24","verse with us luke 9 2 which thought "],["1155.12","which "],["1155.76","states that he sent them out to

was medical evangelism that's "],["1188.96","several components in it first is the "],["1191.44","fact that it is meeting "],["1195.12","the medical and surgical needs of the "],["1197.6","indigent

"],["1442.96","but with the ultimate goal of gaining "],["1445.6","the patience "],["1446.64","and the and the family's trust "],["1450.32","so that we could share with them the "],["1452","best medicine of all "],["1453.76","and that's the gospel of jesus christ "],["1456.559","that is the main thing and we "],["1458.559","strive to keep the main thing the main "],["1460.64","thing and if that ever becomes "],["1462.48","less than the main thing it is time to "],["1464.559","close shop "],["1466.559","this is one of our uh chaplain pastors "],["1469.279","who's just "],["1470.159","sitting with one of the patients are "],["1473.12","being treated "],["1474.64","he's uh you know not just finding out "],["1477.84","you know "],["1478.96","hearing the gospel of

interest "],["1510.72","in the gospel and this is that same "],["1513.2","chaplain who "],["1514","is actually with bible telling her the "],["1516.799","good news "],["1519.52","then the third thing my goal "],["1523.44","i thought was to treat patients and part "],["1525.919","of it was "],["1527.36","part of it was to share the gospel of "],["1529.039","jesus christ and that's true "],["1530.96","as well but it's also to work myself "],["1534.08","out of a job and "],["1537.2","that is what i'm we are focusing on now "],["1540.159","and that's the reason "],["1541.52","reason one of the reasons for the vision "],["1543.679","project "],["1544.799","is we have uh uh "],["1548.08","we need to train ourselves at christian "],["1551.039","brothers and sisters of togo "],["1552.88","how to take care of the hospital not "],["1554.799","just medically and surgically but also "],["1556.72","administrative wise but maintenance-wise "],["1560","etc "],["1560.88","next

"],["1612.159","uh then the third thing too is the fact "],["1615.679","that we "],["1616.48","as part of the vision project we are "],["1618.96","going to start training "],["1620.24","surgeons there's a "],["1623.36","training there's a surgical residency "],["1625.44","called pan-african academy of christian "],["1627.44","surgeons "],["1628.4","who's accredited by loma linda hospital "],["1630.48","in california "],["1632","but it's taught by missionaries "],["1633.44","throughout many "],["1635.279","countries and african we are looking to "],["1637.76","incorporate that "],["1638.64","into our hospital it will be a five-year "],["1641.039","residency "],["1642.159","where they are taught surgical skills so "],["1645.12","they can be actually bored eligible "],["1647.2","uh surgeons but just as important "],["1650.48","they will be discipled they will be "],["1652.48","mentored they'll be "],["1654","involved in a church planning team so "],["1657.12","when they graduate from the residency "],["1660.48","they'll not only be skilled surgeons but "],["1662.24","they'll be christian leaders wherever "],["1663.84","they go "],["1665.76","all right i want to just talk to you "],["1667.279","about three groups "],["1669.44","in togo that are lost first the muslims "],["1673.84","uh next slide uh "],["1677.2","again they compose a good portion of the "],["1679.279","population "],["1680.559","of of togo this uh "],["1683.919","picture concentrate on the lady top left "],["1686.64","this is a "],["1687.279","after photo let me tell you about her "],["1690","she's a muslim lady who was uh "],["1692.08","had a seizure disorder and in togo you "],["1696.159","cook outside the main house and she was "],["1699.12","cooking uh "],["1701.12","a meal she was by herself she had a "],["1702.96","seizure and fell into the fire "],["1704.88","by the time she was found she had "],["1706.96","massive burns to her right arm right "],["1708.96","side of her chest "],["1710","right side of her abdomen they brought "],["1711.76","her to the hospital "],["1713.2","her injuries were so severe that she had "],["1715.76","to have your right arm "],["1717.039","amputated in togo "],["1721.12","in much of africa and much around the "],["1722.799","world when you become "],["1724.159","less than 100 you're

"],["1735.52","so her muslim family sort of sort of "],["1738","stepped back a little bit from her at "],["1739.679","that point "],["1740.64","well she was in the hospital as you can "],["1742.32","imagine for months because she had "],["1744.24","severe burns they had to be taken care "],["1746.08","of "],["1746.559","they had to be de-breeded they had to be "],["1748.399","prepared for "],["1749.76","uh for uh skin grafts "],["1753.679","and that took months and during this "],["1756","time "],["1756.799","our our missionaries as well as our "],["1760.48","nurses "],["1762","they were just showing her the "],["1763.44","compassion of christ "],["1765.12","and when they had the opportunity they "],["1766.72","shared with her the gospel of jesus "],["1768.399","christ "],["1769.279","and she accepted christ as a lord and "],["1771.44","savior "],["1773.279","great for her well when you do that in a "],["1776.559","muslim context "],["1778.08","the muslim family disowns you and so "],["1781.44","there she was at the hospital in agent "],["1784.08","and we took care of her at that point we "],["1786.88","got her in "],["1787.52","uh we got her set up in a little room "],["1790.559","across the street "],["1791.919","where she then started collecting wood "],["1794.559","and "],["1795.039","boiling water and giving it to the "],["1796.88","patients families who came there to take "],["1799.2","care of "],["1800.159","their family members again in togo and "],["1803.279","much of the world "],["1804.72","the hospital does provide food families "],["1808.559","cook outside and they provide the food "],["1811.2","but they need "],["1812.72","uh wood and they need clean water "],["1815.84","so uh so she was doing that but the "],["1818.64","biggest story for her "],["1820.08","and the greatest testimony is she "],["1822.08","started going into the muslim areas "],["1823.919","where "],["1824.32","she had been banished from she started "],["1827.84","sharing bible stories with the kids "],["1832","and now she has a ministry every week "],["1834.48","about 150 "],["1835.44","200 kids come and listen to bible "],["1837.679","stories "],["1838.72","that she comes and talks about she "],["1841.52","actually puts her life "],["1842.799","on the line what a blessing what a "],["1846.32","testimony "],["1847.039","next slide the next group are the "],["1849.6","animists "],["1851.039","they are spirit worshipers or ancestor "],["1853.12","worshipers everybody "],["1855.279","in togo mainly to africa but also around "],["1859.519","the world "],["1860.559","are annabes animus by history "],["1864.24","uh even the christians and muslims in "],["1867.12","togo "],["1868.08","started out their family members as "],["1870","animists they "],["1871.519","worship spirits they think that spirits "],["1874.799","rule their lives whether it be "],["1876.559","good blessings or curses if they get "],["1879.76","sick "],["1880.159","they think that one of their relatives "],["1882.72","who's now "],["1883.44","dead cursed them and gave them the "],["1885.76","illness and that type thing "],["1888.08","so that is something they have "],["1891.2","little statues outside their home where "],["1893.2","they sacrifice chickens and "],["1895.44","goats and whatever like that so they are "],["1898.159","very much "],["1898.72","ruled by by spirits "],["1901.84","next slide this is an example of a "],["1904.159","gentleman who had a moto accident "],["1907.12","and broke his leg and "],["1910.399","obviously he went outside his house and "],["1913.279","sacrificed to his "],["1914.96","uh his statues that didn't work so he "],["1918.559","went to "],["1919.36","a witch doctor and "],["1922.96","they made potions for him and "],["1926.08","sacrifices and all those cost a whole "],["1928","lot of money "],["1929.12","and believe it or not they didn't work "],["1930.559","either and so he finally came to the "],["1933.2","hospital by that time "],["1935.36","his open wound had infected his bone "],["1938.799","and he was there for two three months "],["1941.76","just getting his infection of his bone "],["1944.399","healed and his fracture heal during that "],["1947.6","time "],["1948.48","our staff showed the god you know the "],["1951.039","compassion of christ "],["1953.519","uh and they tried to share the gospel he "],["1956.64","had would have nothing to do with that "],["1958.96","he just resisted all the way so it "],["1962.32","finally one of our chaplains "],["1964.08","uh came up to him with the bible and "],["1966.159","said listen "],["1967.679","we have been trying to be nice to you "],["1969.279","kind to you showing "],["1970.72","showing love and everything like that "],["1973.36","and "],["1974.08","you have just been very very resistant "],["1976.08","to anything "],["1977.6","and so we i want to leave you with god's "],["1979.919","word "],["1980.799","you can do with it what you want to well "],["1984","in togo there's not a whole lot of "],["1985.76","movies "],["1986.96","at nighttime in the hospital there's not "],["1989.2","a whole lot of uh "],["1990.88","computers where you can play video games "],["1992.88","and everything like that "],["1994.399","so he was left basically with a whole "],["1997.44","lot of time on his hand "],["1999.44","and also with uh with god's word and he "],["2003.519","finally opened it up "],["2005.12","reads god's read god's truth and "],["2007.919","accepted christ "],["2008.88","as lord and savior he was ecstatic about "],["2012","that "],["2012.72","he thanked god he thanked the hospital "],["2015.279","he eventually "],["2016.159","got healed and he went home and when he "],["2018.72","came back he was giving glory to god "],["2021.6","and thanking god for the hospital and "],["2023.44","the care they gave him "],["2025.2","when he went home that afternoon he was "],["2027.679","killed in an auto accident "],["2029.84","and god had i mean we had lost a "],["2032.24","physical life "],["2033.519","but god had gained any certain an "],["2035.519","eternal soul in heaven "],["2037.12","and that's what missions is all about "],["2039.44","one "],["2040.24","soul at a time remember that "],["2045.2","next slide and then the third group are "],["2047.919","the people that are aging "],["2049.76","i start to resemble that group here next "],["2052.879","slide "],["2054.24","this is a gentleman who came to the "],["2056.079","hospital about a "],["2057.52","month before cheryl and i left for "],["2059.28","furlough this past fall "],["2062.48","he and his family both claimed he was "],["2064.159","108 years old "],["2066.24","okay that you know we do have some older "],["2070.159","people in togo "],["2071.119","so i don't doubt that he's that old he "],["2072.879","looked that old "],["2074.399","and uh but at the same time uh "],["2079.04","the average life expectancy in togo is "],["2082.079","55 to 57 years of age "],["2085.2","and so his chief complaint "],["2088.879","weakness i'm sorry 108 years old "],["2092.96","if i ever get to 108 every day i'll wake "],["2095.2","up i think my first "],["2096.639","uh words out of my mouth besides god "],["2099.839","thank you for being god by saying "],["2101.76","i am weak but he came to the hospital "],["2104.64","and i started thinking "],["2105.839","why is this guy here he's 108 years old "],["2109.92","weakness is sort of a general complaint "],["2112.56","so i asked "],["2113.52","one of our physician assistants who's "],["2115.28","also a pastor "],["2116.64","to find out is about his spiritual uh "],["2119.76","status found out he was a animist "],["2123.04","found out he had never heard of the "],["2124.88","gospel of jesus christ and he made a "],["2126.64","confession of faith "],["2128.88","a a profession of faith uh for jesus "],["2132.64","christ and we don't know a profession of "],["2134.32","faith "],["2135.04","equals a conversion we'll know in heaven "],["2137.92","whether he's there or not "],["2139.68","but uh but that's just go show you it's "],["2142.72","never too late okay "],["2146.079","uh now missions abroad missions at home "],["2150.079","uh we are uh "],["2154.56","we're all missionaries wherever we are "],["2156.32","whether it be in togo whether it be "],["2158.88","here in maryland next slide "],["2163.28","as as christians we are called to "],["2166.32","prayer support financial support and "],["2168.8","this church is a very "],["2170.079","uh big believer in that ascending as a "],["2172.96","church you've sent "],["2173.839","short a short-term treatment team in the "],["2176.4","past "],["2177.52","and sheryl and i started out as "],["2181.599","short-termers and god led us though to "],["2184.32","career missions "],["2185.839","next slide to whom do we share "],["2189.68","family i found that that's one of the "],["2191.68","toughest "],["2192.8","uh mission fields to do is talking to "],["2195.44","your family because they know "],["2197.119","how sinful you've been in the past and "],["2200.079","so uh "],["2200.96","so that's a very tough feel your friends "],["2204.24","you don't want to step on your friend's "],["2206.24","toes or whatever like that but many of "],["2208.16","your friends "],["2209.28","are lost and they need to receive the "],["2212","good news "],["2213.04","and then again your neighbors how many "],["2215.92","people here really know the names of all "],["2217.68","their neighbors "],["2220.88","it's important to go visit them showing "],["2223.44","them that you care even if they just say "],["2225.2","how you're doing "],["2226.24","and the first three or four times you "],["2227.68","see them how you doing they say okay i'm "],["2229.44","doing fine "],["2230.4","but when you start to show that you are "],["2233.68","you care about them then they're going "],["2237.04","to start opening up "],["2238.24","and when they start opening up you can "],["2240.64","be praying for them "],["2242.24","and eventually you'll have that time to "],["2244.16","share the gospel with jesus christ "],["2246.48","next slide so it's called building "],["2249.28","relationships with muslims you don't "],["2251.28","share the gospel right off "],["2252.72","you build relationships and that could "],["2255.359","take "],["2256.16","months that could take years but it's a "],["2259.44","process "],["2260.64","now if somebody comes into the hospital "],["2262.48","and they're in the process of dying "],["2264.16","they're going to hear the gospel from me "],["2266.8","but otherwise muslims you build "],["2269.68","relationships just like you "],["2271.76","do with uh maybe your friends as well "],["2274.64","and uh "],["2275.359","then being a good neighbor again "],["2278.4","in luke chapter 10 talks about the good "],["2280.64","samaritan "],["2282.079","the good samaritan did not start out "],["2284.48","that day "],["2285.119","looking at his cell phone and his "],["2287.52","calendar "],["2288.16","and say okay at 10 15 this morning i'm "],["2290.64","going to come by "],["2292.079","a guy who has been beaten up and robbed "],["2294.48","on the side of the road and i'm going to "],["2295.839","stop and help him "],["2297.119","no that doesn't that wasn't part of it "],["2299.92","it was a god's appointment "],["2301.76","but the good samaritan was willing and "],["2304.32","he was available "],["2306.56","and he stopped and helped next slide "],["2312","so again you build relationships and "],["2314.88","then when the time is right "],["2317.2","you share with them the best medicine of "],["2320.56","all and that's the gospel of jesus "],["2322.079","christ and then "],["2323.599","you go from there now next slide "],["2327.68","what to expect as a christian "],["2330.96","you do not save souls "],["2334.72","the holy spirit is the one who saves "],["2337.2","people's souls "],["2339.359","your job is to share the good news "],["2343.599","god didn't call you to be successful in "],["2345.839","every time you shared the gospel "],["2347.68","but he did call you to be faithful and "],["2350.96","share the gospel "],["2353.04","okay the holy spirit is the one that "],["2356.16","uses that gospel message "],["2358.24","to bring the ones to the foot of the "],["2359.839","cross that he has chosen "],["2362.56","and then again paul again said that "],["2366.079","i planted apollo's watered but god gave "],["2368.72","the growth "],["2369.599","that's something we need to remember as "],["2371.359","christians and again you may just be "],["2373.28","talking to somebody building "],["2374.32","relationships and it just takes time "],["2376.96","to build that relationship and planting "],["2379.68","seeds "],["2380.32","watering and just being there for them "],["2383.359","and again god calls us to be the salt

have a bunch that i want to get "],["38.48","into "],["39.04","so we're going to dive headlong into "],["41.76","this today "],["43.76","so most of you who know me probably know "],["47.2","that i came to christ "],["48.96","later in life i was in my late 20s when "],["52.079","i did and prior to that i was "],["54","a theistic agnostic and agnostic "],["57.36","is one who believes that it's impossible "],["60.239","to know whether or not there really is a "],["62.16","god "],["62.96","but i was a theistic agnostic so i "],["65.84","leaned logically to the side that there "],["68.479","essentially "],["69.84","was a god that there had to be a god "],["72.88","that a god was necessary for "],["76.08","this for everything not just this "],["78.56","building but what's outside of it "],["83.84","i did however believe that it was "],["85.759","impossible to actually "],["87.84","know that god um "],["91.2","one who knew me might say that because "],["94.4","of "],["94.72","my beliefs and that philosophy that i "],["97.2","had "],["97.92","quote unquote doubts about the god of "],["101.04","the bible "],["102.64","and according to merriam webster a doubt "],["106.479","is a lack of confidence or a distrust "],["109.68","it could also be defined as an "],["111.2","uncertainty of belief or opinion "],["113.6","that often interferes with decision "],["116.159","making "],["117.119","so i suppose miriam webster would agree "],["120.96","that i "],["121.52","in fact had doubts and it would be this "],["125.28","meaning of doubt "],["126.479","that we people of the western world "],["129.599","which by the way in the bible they would "],["131.2","call the greek world "],["134.319","it's this meaning that we would most "],["135.92","likely read and we "],["137.36","probably have already read into today's "],["140.64","text and so we're going to look at the "],["142","text of matthew and see if i "],["144","am in fact correct in my assessment "],["147.599","so matthew 14 verses 22 to 31 "],["152.319","immediately he made the disciples get "],["154.72","into the boat and go ahead of them to "],["156.239","the other side "],["157.28","while he sent the crowds away after he "],["160.72","had sent the crowds away he went up on "],["162.319","the mountain by himself to pray "],["164.08","and when it was evening he was there "],["166.08","alone but the boat was already a long "],["168.48","distance from the land battered by the "],["170.56","waves "],["172.08","for the wind was contrary and in the "],["175.28","fourth watch of the night he came to "],["177.04","them "],["177.599","walking on the sea when the disciples "],["180.319","saw him walking on the sea "],["182.08","they were terrified as one would "],["184.879","probably be "],["185.84","and said it's a ghost "],["189.2","and they cried out in fear "],["192.239","but immediately jesus spoke to them "],["194","saying take courage "],["196.8","it is i do not be afraid "],["200.319","peter said to him lord if it is you "],["203.44","command me to come to you on the water "],["207.2","and that's an important statement "],["209.2","and he said jesus said come and that is "],["212.4","an important statement because that is a "],["213.84","command that is an imperative "],["216.48","and peter got out of the boat and walked "],["218.72","on the water and came toward jesus "],["220.879","but seeing the wind he became frightened "],["224.239","and beginning to sink he cried out lord "],["227.28","save me immediately jesus stretched out "],["230.4","his hand "],["231.36","took hold of him and said to him you "],["234.959","of little faith "],["238.4","why did you doubt "],["244.08","now the greek idea of faith "],["247.76","the western idea of faith is "],["249.28","inextricably linked to the concept of "],["252.159","cognitive "],["253.36","conscious agreement if i have faith in "],["256.799","the greek sense "],["258.32","then i am intellectually convinced that "],["260.639","something "],["261.519","is true "],["265.28","i trust that it is true and it's this "],["267.68","greek idea "],["269.04","that permeates our culture our western "],["272.08","mode "],["272.8","of thought if someone loses faith "],["276.479","or in the case of our text doubts "],["281.04","what we're saying is that that person no "],["282.88","longer holds to their convictions "],["285.12","as to what is true that he or she maybe "],["289.04","change their mind or is changing their "],["292.16","mind "],["293.68","this would be to suggest in this context "],["297.52","that somehow as peter walked upon the "],["300.88","waves "],["301.68","he began to question or become "],["303.919","cognitively confused "],["305.759","as to whether or not jesus could help "],["308.56","him "],["308.88","walk on the water or whether or not he "],["311.84","actually was "],["313.039","walking on water so he began to "],["316.32","doubt what was happening according to "],["319.199","miriam "],["319.919","webster does that sound like it makes "],["322.84","sense "],["325.6","some related biblical words in english "],["328.88","might be unbelief and we're going to "],["330.56","look at that a little later "],["332","or maybe the term uncertainty "],["335.12","now the new testament was written in "],["338.08","coiny greek "],["339.36","the common greek language but jesus and "],["341.919","his followers probably "],["343.44","most commonly spoke in aramaic now "],["345.84","aramaic is the post "],["347.12","babylonian exile language of the jews "],["350.88","he probably would not have spoken greek "],["353.28","and jesus would be of a "],["355.12","hebraic mindset not a greek "],["358.8","mindset and with this understanding "],["362.72","things get a little interesting here "],["365.759","in the hebrew language which is the "],["369.039","primary language of the old testament "],["371.039","and thus "],["371.6","is the primary language of this hebraic "],["374.479","mindset "],["375.68","the word for doubt or uncertainty as we "],["379.039","understand those words "],["380.479","was safe and the word for certainty "],["383.919","or doubtless as we understand those "],["387.759","words today "],["388.96","was vedae interesting fact "],["393.12","neither one of those hebrew words appear "],["396","anywhere "],["396.88","in the entirety of biblical writing "],["401.28","nowhere does the torah or any of the "],["404.08","other hebrew scriptures "],["405.6","mention the hebrew words for either "],["407.919","doubt "],["409.52","cognitive doubt or certainty so let me "],["412.8","say that again to hammer this in "],["415.039","there is no word in biblical hebrew "],["418.08","for the greek or western understanding "],["420.96","of the words doubt "],["422.56","or uncertainty or for that matter "],["425.52","certainty "],["429.599","now there's two greek words that your "],["431.84","bible probably "],["432.96","translates as doubt and then there's a "],["435.36","third word "],["436","which is apistia or apisteos depending "],["438","on the form that is usually translated "],["440","as "],["440.24","unbelief but we're going to get to that "],["442.24","one later "],["443.44","the first word in question is the greek "],["445.52","word diacrino "],["448.479","and we're going to look at several "],["449.84","verses that contain this word "],["451.759","as the root for your english translation "],["454.24","doubt "],["455.44","the problem is that according to the "],["458.96","theological dictionary of the new "],["460.8","testament "],["462.08","the meaning doubt for the greek word "],["465.28","diacrino does not exist "],["468.4","prior to the new testament "],["472.08","now that means in classical greek "],["474.879","writings "],["476.319","in the 2 septuagint which is the the the "],["478.639","greek translation of the old testament "],["480.479","that was written in the third to second "],["481.84","centuries bc or in "],["483.599","any other greek text "],["486.72","prior to the new testament in all of "],["490.16","those writings "],["491.36","deucrino never "],["494.639","means to doubt as we understand that "],["497.12","word today "],["501.199","contemporary uh example like the 1960s "],["505.199","definition of the word groovy "],["507.44","did not match the 1860s definition of "],["510.08","the word groovy "],["511.599","or any other era's definition of groovy "],["514.8","you dig "],["518.839","okay let's reading back "],["522.08","into it the greek word most associated "],["526.16","with the hebrew words that are "],["527.68","translated doubt "],["529.279","in your english bibles is the word "],["530.959","destazo "],["532.72","and that's the greek word of matthew 14 "],["535.68","31 "],["537.2","but to understand the meaning of this "],["539.36","greek word "],["540.959","and therefore our translated word we "],["544.08","have to look at the meaning "],["545.12","of the hebrew words plural "],["548.399","that are translated doubt and were "],["550.88","translated "],["553.12","vestazo in your english copy of the old "],["556.959","testament "],["558.399","now this is a very very long word study "],["561.76","that i don't have time to fully cover so "],["564.399","i am going to summarize "],["566.16","you're welcome first point "],["570.24","sometimes where your bible has the word "],["573.04","doubt "],["573.92","there is actually no hebrew word behind "],["576.72","it "],["578.08","i'll explain if you look at probably the "],["580.8","first instance that you can find doubt "],["582.8","in your bible especially if you have an "],["584.24","esv "],["585.44","uh it's going to be in genesis 37 33. "],["592.88","what happened i got "],["596.399","that's it's no i'm hitting the right one "],["600","sorry this happened first service too "],["601.6","and i hit the buttons and everything "],["602.88","goes crazy can you do it carl "],["605.519","there you go so we're going to put this "],["608.24","away "],["609.44","so i'm not tempted all right so where "],["612.88","are we "],["614.079","all right so this is the first instance "],["616.16","you see the phrase at the end there "],["618.8","joseph is without doubt torn to pieces "],["622.56","now other translations um if you have "],["624.72","the nasby for instance or maybe "],["626","yesterday whatever "],["627.04","it might say shortly or something like "],["629.36","that but the point still stands here "],["631.44","in the hebrew what you have is a "],["633.44","repetition "],["634.48","of the word tiraph the word tiraf means "],["638.72","torn to pieces "],["641.04","so literally the verse reads is torn to "],["644.079","pieces "],["645.04","is torn to pieces "],["648.079","there's no mention of doubt or no doubt "],["653.519","doubt is implied because of the "],["655.519","repetition but there's no word there "],["658.32","okay and that happens a couple of times "],["660.959","in the old testament the second point "],["663.36","when there is a hebrew word "],["666.48","behind the english translation doubt and "],["669.36","again "],["669.839","i'm just summarizing because this was a "],["672.959","long time "],["674.32","the meaning always always "],["677.76","conveys a failure to act or a lack "],["681.44","of action to be more precise it conveys "],["684.56","a meaning of disobedience "],["687.68","it never is a lack of a mental "],["691.279","understanding "],["692.399","or of some mental agreement "],["695.6","as a matter of fact the person's "],["697.519","understanding or agreement "],["699.68","is completely irrelevant "],["703.76","and we're going to explore that later if "],["705.279","we have time the point is that these "],["707.519","meanings are western meaning of doubt "],["710.16","the greek meaning "],["711.279","of doubt are applied by greek thinking "],["715.36","hellenistic jews and christians not by "],["718.48","hebraic thinking "],["720","hebrew thinking jews and christians "],["724.24","this interpretation comes after "],["727.68","the bible is written and so now i ask "],["731.36","of which mindset was jesus a greek "],["734.48","mindset "],["735.76","for a jewish hebraic mindset "],["741.36","that is rhetorical because he was not "],["743.519","and i can emphatically say this "],["746.48","jesus was not a hellenized jew "],["750.16","and therefore he would not have used the "],["753.68","hellenized meaning "],["755.04","of these words he would have had and "],["757.279","used the hebraic "],["759.04","understanding so there's your background "],["766.24","i take a long time on background um "],["770.959","let's look to our teachers first up we "],["773.76","have peter "],["774.88","from matthew 14. "],["778.56","he got out of the boat "],["781.6","he's on the waves he's a pillar "],["785.519","of faith he's the only one who got out "],["787.519","of the boat "],["789.279","and then he starts to sink "],["793.76","here we have that greek word destazo "],["797.04","now what the greek word destazo actually "],["799.519","means is to waiver "],["801.6","to hesitate to delay "],["806.079","nothing about doubt that comes later "],["812.079","it does not mean in any way shape or "],["815.839","form "],["816.56","mental confusion or questioning jesus "],["819.6","does not rebuke him for not mentally "],["823.199","believing mark chapter 9. "],["828.399","verse 17 and 29 and one of the crowd "],["831.199","answered him teacher i brought you my "],["832.88","son "],["833.279","possessed with a spirit which makes him "],["835.12","mute and whenever it sees "],["836.88","him it slams him to the ground and he "],["838.72","foams at the mouth and he "],["840.24","grinds his teeth and stiffens out i told "],["842.88","your disciples to cast it out "],["845.04","and they could not do it and he answered "],["848.32","them and said "],["848.959","oh unbelieving generation how long shall "],["852.399","i be with you "],["853.36","how long shall i put up with you bring "],["855.68","him to me "],["857.12","they brought the boy to him when he saw "],["858.639","him immediately the spirit threw him "],["860.639","into a convulsion "],["861.76","and falling to the ground he began "],["863.44","rolling around and foaming at the mouth "],["866","and he asked his father how long has "],["868.16","this been happening to him "],["870.24","again he already knew but he asked and "],["872.16","he said from childhood "],["873.68","it has often thrown him both into the "],["875.76","fire and into the water to destroy him "],["878.48","but if you can do anything take pity on "],["880.959","us and help us "],["882.24","and jesus said to him if you can "],["887.519","all things are possible to him who "],["889.199","believes "],["890.88","immediately the boy's father cried out "],["892.639","and said i do "],["894","believe help my unbelief "],["898.8","and when jesus saw that a crowd was "],["900.56","rapidly gathering he rebuked the unclean "],["902.8","spirit saying to it "],["903.92","you deaf and mute spirit i command you "],["906.399","come out of him "],["907.519","and do not enter him again after crying "],["910.639","out and throwing him into a terrible "],["912","convulsions it came out and the boy "],["914.24","became so much like a corpse "],["916.16","that most of them said he is dead "],["919.6","but jesus took him by the hand raised "],["921.279","him he got up "],["922.639","when he came into the house his "],["923.76","disciples began questioning him "],["925.199","privately why "],["926","could we not drive it out and he said to "],["928","him this kind cannot come out "],["930.399","by anything but prayer and action "],["935.04","now here we have the greek words apistos "],["938.48","in that verse and apistia "],["942.32","both negations of the word pistus "],["945.44","the a means like un um "],["948.72","which means belief faithfulness "],["950.88","truthfulness honesty integrity "],["953.04","and while the greek understanding of "],["954.959","this would be "],["956.32","cognitive and mental the hebrew concept "],["960.72","of belief and all those other words i "],["962.88","just said is mostly "],["964.8","active so if the greek word "],["968.399","apistia is the proper translation of the "],["971.6","hebrew word "],["972.8","that he actually would have said then "],["975.44","what he said "],["976.32","is a matter of unfaithfulness not a "],["979.44","matter of "],["980.839","doubt "],["983.36","in spite of his desire to see his son "],["985.759","healed "],["987.44","he's unable to act this guy "],["991.44","came to jesus and his disciples because "],["994.32","he wanted his son to be well "],["996.399","and he either saw others be healed or he "],["999.759","heard "],["1000.56","of others be healed "],["1004","but when he goes to the disciples he "],["1007.279","probably expected that

redeem it "],["1516.48","but if not tell me that i may know for "],["1518.799","there is no one but you to redeem it "],["1520.88","and i am after you and he said i will "],["1523.679","redeem it "],["1524.72","now boaz said okay on that day you buy "],["1527.84","the field from the hand of naomi "],["1529.44","you must also acquire ruth the moabitus "],["1532.24","the widow of the deceased "],["1533.919","in order to raise up the name of the "],["1535.36","deceased on his inheritance "],["1537.52","the closest relative said i cannot "],["1539.44","redeem it for myself

the "],["1549.279","custom in former times "],["1550.96","in israel concerning the redemption and "],["1552.88","the exchange of land "],["1554.32","to confirm any matter a man removed his

relative said to boaz buy "],["1567.44","it for yourself and he removed his "],["1568.96","sandal "],["1569.6","then boaz said to the elders and all the "],["1571.279","people you are witnesses today "],["1573.36","that i have bought from the hand of "],["1574.64","naomi all that belonged to elimelech and "],["1576.96","all that belonged to chilean "],["1578.4","and maelon and moreover i've

that the name of the deceased will "],["1588.72","not be cut off from his brothers or from "],["1590.96","the court of his birthplace "],["1592.559","you are witnesses today all the people

"],["1610.84","moreover may your house be like the "],["1613.279","house of perez "],["1614.48","whom tomorrow bore to judah through the "],["1616.64","offspring "],["1617.52","which the lord will give you by this "],["1619.52","young woman so boaz took ruth she became "],["1622.08","his wife "],["1622.64","he went into her and the lord enabled "],["1625.12","her to conceive "],["1626.159","and she gave birth to a son then the "],["1628","women said to naomi blessed is the lord "],["1629.919","who has not left you without a redeemer "],["1631.52","today "],["1632.08","and may his name become

to you than seven sons "],["1642.48","has given birth to him again i know that "],["1645.52","was long "],["1648.64","but a couple of observations "],["1651.84","first we see in verses 11 to 12 "],["1655.279","boaz prays for ruth "],["1660.159","ask god for his blessings for ruth but "],["1663.44","notice "],["1664.159","what he does he immediately performs the "],["1668.96","actions that will be the answer to his "],["1672.24","own prayer "],["1676.559","he feeds her he gives her abundance and "],["1679.36","sends her away further in chapter 3 "],["1681.039","verse 10 "],["1684.24","we see boaz again pray for ruth "],["1687.6","and then something interesting naomi "],["1690.559","makes a strong statement "],["1692.08","about the faith of boaz about boaz's "],["1696","lack of doubt he will not "],["1700","rest until he is settled until he has "],["1703.2","seen his prayer come true "],["1708.84","today "],["1710.48","boaz prayed for you to be blessed for "],["1712.559","your kindness "],["1713.919","and he's not going to rest until "],["1716.96","you are blessed for your kindness "],["1721.52","and after the whole long mid-eastern "],["1724.08","legal thingy "],["1725.279","which is the technical theological term "],["1728.72","boaz then gives witness "],["1732","to the blessings of god and he informs "],["1735.6","the people "],["1736.48","that they in fact are witness to the "],["1739.84","blessings "],["1741.76","of god and then they pray "],["1744.88","that boaz's line that comes from this "],["1747.279","woman be blessed "],["1748.48","so boaz sets about "],["1751.679","making sure that prayer be fulfilled "],["1755.2","which sometimes side note serving the "],["1757.44","lord can be fun "],["1763.279","just saying okay so he sets apart "],["1766.559","making sure that that's going to happen "],["1772","and then the women they pray "],["1775.2","for naomi and her grandson which that "],["1778.559","prayer can extend to all the generations "],["1780.64","of her husband's house from this point "],["1782.48","on "],["1783.039","and i really hope you see the messianic "],["1786","prophecy in that "],["1788.559","because "],["1792.64","the neighbor women gave him a name "],["1794.32","saying a son has been born to naomi so "],["1796.24","they named him obed "],["1797.84","he is the father of

missing a very important sign and "],["179.68","the sign was "],["180.72","that my sister's life was a wreck my "],["183.84","other sister's life was headed "],["185.599","for a wreck my cousins who were all "],["188.4","doing the same thing "],["189.92","all of our lives were headed for a "],["193.04","terrible "],["193.68","ending and as it says it's said "],["196.879","dead end stupid and i didn't get that "],["203.04","i didn't get it at all but then "],["206.319","one night "],["210.959","i'm feeling all caged up "],["214.159","and my friend invites me to this meeting "],["218.08","and i don't really want to go i even "],["220.319","make the mis "],["222.08","statement i can't go and "],["225.12","it was true my parents said i've been "],["226.879","away from home too much "],["228.56","and they just want me home this week "],["231.84","it's on a wednesday night and this "],["233.04","evangelist had been preaching in chapel "],["234.879","and i really didn't like him "],["236.4","because he made me feel uncomfortable "],["239.599","about the way i was living and other "],["242","things in that "],["243.599","this jesus thing "],["247.439","but he kept insisting that i come and i "],["251.04","said well my parents won't let me and he "],["252.799","said well "],["253.439","i already called your parents and "],["254.959","they're coming tonight "],["258.32","you jerk "],["262.479","so we go that night and this guy dr "],["265.199","david anderson evangelist dr david "],["267.36","sanders and he starts preaching "],["269.04","and he says we're all born in this river "],["270.96","of life and "],["272.479","as we go down this river of life it's as "],["274.88","natural for us to go down this river as "],["276.8","it is for us to breathe "],["279.84","but the end of this river of life "],["284.16","is eternal life without god "],["287.44","in hell but god in his love puts "],["291.44","these log jams in your life and i'm like "],["295.12","okay i'm interested "],["298.88","he might put a log jam of a parent "],["301.919","especially a father getting right with "],["303.68","god and starting to read the bible "],["305.919","together as a family "],["308.88","who that happened "],["311.919","it might be a tv evangelist speaking "],["314.08","that might get your attention "],["315.919","the only reason i was at a christian "],["317.52","school is because my dad turned off the "],["319.039","james bond movie on a sunday night "],["321.28","and there was this christian school hour "],["323.039","the only night in the 32 years of the "],["324.8","program they talked about the christian "],["326.4","school "],["331.919","and i blurted out i'd like to go there "],["334.08","my dad got so excited i couldn't say i "],["336.32","was kidding "],["338.5","[Applause] "],["341.28","so i end up going to this christian "],["343.28","school "],["344.96","and then he says the next law jimmy "],["346.479","might be a friend "],["348.08","who got right with god and invited you "],["350.639","here tonight "],["352","so that was ed at pyle we had been "],["354.479","partying the year before "],["356","he was two years older and we would get "],["358","away from the school "],["359.36","part way home because that's whose house "],["360.96","i would stay at and we would you know do "],["363.12","all the stuff that "],["365.28","you don't do when you're when you that "],["367.199","you do do when you are a christian "],["370","and i was so excited about all these "],["371.68","things and then "],["373.36","but realizing that all the wait god said "],["376.4","what "],["377.6","these are log jams in my life and ed "],["379.68","invited me this night "],["384.24","all of a sudden i realized that all "],["386.08","these circumstances i thought were "],["388.24","just randomly happening god was "],["391.52","orchestrating because he loved me "],["395.36","now i had heard john 3 16 a thousand "],["398.72","times by now "],["400","oh my gosh every single chapel speaker "],["403.36","had to somehow get to john 3 16. "],["406.479","and there's this evangelist he gets to "],["408.319","john 3 16 and he says "],["410","it's because for god so loved the world "],["413.36","and i was beginning to realize holy cow "],["418.08","that might include me and then he says "],["420.88","there's this last "],["422","log jam let me excuse me this last "],["425.12","sandbar "],["426.24","is you're going and there's three "],["428.16","crosses on the sandbar and there's jesus "],["430.4","at the sandbar "],["431.44","with his arms wide open waiting to "],["434.479","accept you because he loves you so much "],["437.28","he died on the cross for you "],["440.72","i was like holy cats "],["445.12","i'm gripping the seat at this point "],["450","and i turned to my friend ed and said ed "],["453.52","i want to go forward tonight and trust "],["455.44","christ as my savior "],["458.479","and he was like huh i thought you were "],["463.36","nope but it was that night i realized "],["466.879","that jesus christ "],["468.319","loved me and it's that i want to briefly "],["470.879","talk to you about tonight "],["472.8","about that he died on the cross to pay "],["475.919","for our "],["476.72","sins it is just this incredible truth "],["480.72","now i want us to read together the "],["483.12","apostles creed there's a reason for this "],["484.96","we're going to "],["485.84","jam it all in here together real quick "],["488.56","the apostles creed was taught to "],["490.56","early believers remember they did not "],["492.319","have the bibles like we have today "],["494.8","they were like hey we need to make sure "],["496.479","people believe right things "],["498.16","do right things and have good "],["499.84","relationships so let's "],["502.319","teach them a creed is just a belief "],["504.56","statement "],["505.84","let's teach them the ten commandments "],["508.319","and let's "],["509.12","teach them the lord's prayer they had to "],["511.36","memorize these "],["513.2","so we're just going to read the apostles "],["515.919","creed "],["516.56","please read it with me i believe in god "],["520.32","the father almighty creator of heaven "],["522.88","and earth "],["523.68","i believe in jesus christ his only son "],["526.88","our lord who was conceived by the holy "],["529.6","spirit "],["530.24","and born of the virgin mary he suffered "],["532.959","under pontius pilate "],["534.64","he was crucified died and was buried he "],["537.76","descended to hell "],["539.2","the third day he rose again from the "],["541.2","dead he ascended to heaven "],["543.519","and is seated at the right hand of god "],["546","the father almighty "],["547.6","from there he will come to judge the "],["549.68","living and the dead "],["551.12","i believe in the holy spirit the holy "],["553.68","catholic church "],["554.959","the communion of saints and the "],["557.04","forgiveness of sins "],["558.64","the resurrection of the body and of life "],["561.44","everlasting "],["562.56","amen now we want to just focus on the "],["565.839","one part of this we want to focus on "],["567.44","jesus christ and what he did "],["569.92","so i believe in jesus christ his only "],["572.24","son our lord who is conceived by the "],["574","holy spirit "],["574.959","and born of the virgin mary galatians 4 "],["578.399","tells us "],["580","that when the fullness of time was to "],["581.6","come god sent "],["583.36","forth his son born of woman born "],["586.48","under the law so god in his miraculous "],["590.399","timing "],["591.04","which i was getting really familiar with "],["593.279","after all those "],["594.64","road log jams that i realized god had "],["597.279","orchestrated "],["598.72","when god says that he at the right time "],["602.16","at the perfect time sent jesus he means "],["605.12","he orchestrated everything from "],["607.68","beginning before time began to the "],["609.839","creation "],["610.72","that the this lamb was slain before the "],["612.88","foundation of the world he had "],["614.079","everything figured out and planned out "],["616.24","before anything started why because "],["619.44","god is a planner and he is a lover "],["623.839","and he planned to love us for all "],["626","eternity "],["627.04","and he said everything perfectly in "],["629.76","motion "],["630.64","i believe in jesus christ now this is "],["633.2","extremely important "],["634.48","because in acts 16 31 and the "],["638","philippian jailer says what must i do to "],["640.16","be saved and they said believe in the "],["642.16","lord jesus christ "],["643.44","and you will be saved and your household "],["647.279","i mean it impacts so many people "],["651.12","and we want to see his son his only son "],["653.68","our lord "],["654.48","oh this gets good "],["657.519","thomas you guys remember thomas thomas "],["661.2","jesus had appeared to the disciples "],["662.959","after the resurrection "],["664.399","and he's like man unless i see his side "],["667.12","put my hand "],["667.76","in it put my hand in the nail print in "],["669.92","his hands i'm not going to believe "],["671.76","and jesus shows up again with thomas "],["674.8","there "],["675.519","and he doesn't say thomas you doubt her "],["677.6","he goes hey thomas "],["679.04","come here put your hand right here "],["682.959","i loved you this much and i care for you "],["685.76","right now "],["686.88","i want you to believe touch it "],["691.36","this is what was pierced for you "],["694.64","and thomas immediately says what my lord "],["699.519","and my god jesus is lord he "],["703.04","is god but there was a big debate going "],["706.48","on "],["706.8","at the time that the apostle creed was "],["708.959","written and "],["710.88","a lot of people said jesus was "],["714","only man because god could never "],["717.92","come down and live the life that he "],["719.839","lived and die "],["721.519","and others said well he's only god "],["724.8","because only god could pay for all of "],["727.12","our sin "],["728.48","and god said hey watch this i got this "],["731.2","covered "],["733.12","and he's amazing because he does that "],["735.36","because jesus is "],["736.32","man and god he was conceived by the "],["741.839","when you're conceived by the holy spirit "],["744.079","you're "],["745.279","you're god and born of the virgin mary "],["748.959","oh you're also man "],["752.72","i love this now it says an angel came in "],["756.079","luke 1 31 "],["757.44","and behold the angel said to mary you "],["759.76","will conceive in your womb and bear son "],["762.24","and you shall call his name jesus he "],["764.639","will be great will be called the son of "],["766.56","the most high "],["767.519","and the lord god will give to him the "],["769.44","throne of his father david "],["771.2","and he will reign over the house of "],["772.88","jacob forever and of his kingdom "],["775.44","there will be no end and mary's like "],["779.12","huh "],["782.959","i've never known a man how is this going "],["786.48","to work "],["790.079","i'm a virgin and the holy spirit "],["793.6","said this i mean the angel said this the "],["795.68","holy spirit will come upon you "],["798.079","and the power of the most high will "],["800.24","overshadow you "],["802.079","therefore the child to be born will be "],["804.8","called "],["805.839","holy the son of god "],["810.639","why did he need to be man because man is "],["812.959","the one who transgressed "],["814.24","in the garden man is the one whose sin "],["816","needed to be paid for "],["817.6","the only problem is if he was just a man "],["821.519","he would be born with sin and he would "],["824","have to pay for his "],["825.839","own sin he had to also be "],["829.44","god because he could then be the perfect "],["833.44","sacrifice "],["834.639","but not only did he need to be god to "],["837.04","pay the perfect sacrifice "],["839.12","but only a god could pay an eternal "],["842.56","sacrifice that covers all sin "],["845.92","from beginning to end and that's what "],["848.32","jesus "],["848.959","christ did and he suffered "],["852.24","under pontius pilate was crucified died "],["856.24","and was buried "],["857.76","he descended to hell the third day he "],["860.16","rose again from the dead "],["862.32","wow jesus saves i love this "],["866.48","in first corinthians 15 it kind of is a "],["868.72","creed right there a creedal statement "],["870.72","the first five verses when paul's "],["873.12","writing "],["873.76","he says now i remind you brothers of the "],["875.6","gospel i preached to you "],["877.36","which you received in which you stand "],["879.36","and by which you are "],["880.88","being saved if you hold fast the word i "],["883.36","preached to you "],["884.8","unless you believed in vain for i "],["887.92","delivered unto you of first importance "],["890.8","but i also received that christ "],["894.32","died for our sins "],["899.04","in accordance with the scripture that he "],["900.639","was burying that was raised again the "],["902.16","third day but "],["902.88","christ died for "],["906.24","our sins "],["910.88","the writer paul is emphasizing that "],["914.48","christ really lived "],["916.16","really died was really buried and really "],["919.04","rose again "],["921.44","he's emphasizing that these are facts "],["924","and what's amazing about "],["925.36","all the early writing around that time "],["927.199","of um "],["929.44","non-christian historians none of them "],["932.32","deny that jesus lived and none of them "],["934.399","denied that jesus died and none of them "],["936.24","deny that jesus rose from the dead "],["939.04","because there wasn't proof that he "],["942.32","didn't "],["942.88","there was only proof that he did these "],["944.72","things then paul "],["946.24","emphasizes this fact again "],["949.36","that christ died for us "],["953.759","now it's important to realize that "],["955.6","because christ died for us "],["957.759","something amazing happened "],["960.959","he descended to hell now i know this is "],["963.199","a controversial statement so "],["964.88","i'm going to cover right over it um "],["968.32","just just kidding "],["973.199","there's some debate about what this "],["974.56","means did they just mean that he was "],["976.32","buried in the grave "],["977.759","what does it all mean well i think of it "],["980","when you take an "],["980.959","eternal aspect of it it makes perfect "],["984.16","sense "],["985.6","christ suffered the eternity of hell "],["988.88","on the moment of the cross for all of us "],["992.8","what do you mean by that first peter "],["996","2 24 says he himself "],["999.12","bore our sins "],["1004.8","and his body on the tree "],["1009.199","then we might die to sin and live to "],["1011.12","righteousness by his wounds "],["1014.079","we are healed "],["1018","he himself bore our sins on the tree "],["1021.36","colossians 2 14 tells us this by "],["1024.559","canceling "],["1027.679","the record of debt that stood against us "],["1031.199","with all of its legal demands the record "],["1034.4","of debt "],["1035.12","was an eternal record you know all "],["1036.88","everything we've done is written "],["1038.72","in the book "],["1041.839","and that book is eternal you know it's "],["1044.959","there forever and unless somebody pays a "],["1047.919","forever price "],["1049.2","it's there and he took all of that "],["1052.48","eternity of debt "],["1054.72","all sins past all sins present and all "],["1057.76","sins that will ever be committed "],["1066","and he took it and became that "],["1070.24","because that's what says was nailed to "],["1072","the cross "],["1075.28","cancelling the record of our debt "],["1078.64","which stood against us with this legal "],["1080.64","amends "],["1081.84","he set it aside nailing it to the cross "],["1087.84","you see he did more than just pay for "],["1090","all of our sin "],["1092.799","it was in the passage in isaiah and it's "],["1094.72","also in second corinthians 5 21 for our "],["1097.52","sake "],["1098.08","he made him to be sin for us who knew no "],["1101.36","sin "],["1102.4","so that we might become the "],["1105.36","righteousness "],["1106.24","of god it's called the great exchange "],["1110.4","god takes all of our sin "],["1113.919","everything we've ever done wrong "],["1116.24","everything we "],["1117.039","should have

"],["1142.24","loves us "],["1143.039","that i mean there is no other exclama "],["1145.36","explanation that makes any sense "],["1148.84","whatsoever "],["1152.08","and "],["1155.12","if he didn't

"],["27.359","the first time i just want to say "],["29.679","i'm not the guy who's usually up here "],["31.199","give us a second chance "],["33.04","all right so uh welcome uh "],["36.399","glad you're here i did some looking it "],["38.96","seems the last time i preached a "],["41.36","christmas message and i do this for a "],["43.84","reason you'll understand "],["45.52","i was in 2013 i had a message "],["48.719","entitled why christmas anyway "],["51.76","and i've entitled this one what's it "],["53.92","worth because "],["55.039","evidently i get very inquisitive around "],["58.16","this time of year "],["59.359","and i'm full of questions so "],["63.84","we take this time every year to remember "],["67.2","the birth of our savior king "],["70.24","uh we have the manger and the star "],["73.439","and the shepherds and their sheep "],["76.479","there's the carpenter and his betrothed "],["79.36","traveling to bethlehem for the census "],["82.4","and of course we have the baby "],["86","now all of this all of these elements "],["88.56","are just "],["89.119","elements of a greater story and yes "],["92.72","i'm even referring to the child "],["95.84","they're pivotal elements "],["99.759","but they're just elements of a greater "],["102.079","story that begins "],["104.079","long before the edict of quirinius "],["106.72","issued somewhere between "],["108.079","6 and 4 bc so let's pray "],["112.32","father god we want to thank you thank "],["115.04","you for this time "],["116.719","uh this time of remembrance "],["120.079","of when our savior when our messiah came "],["122.399","to earth we thank you lord for the birth "],["124.399","of christ "],["125.6","and we thank you lord for having me "],["128.879","written down that we can look at it and "],["131.28","we thank you god for "],["132.72","for the saving grace that he's offered "],["135.04","to us and so we ask you now lord "],["137.04","to just quiet our hearts open our ears "],["139.92","open our minds to what it is you have "],["142","for us this morning i just asked that "],["144.239","you would uh "],["145.12","be with me as i speak your words erase "],["148.16","anything that is not yours and uh just "],["150.64","help me stay focused on on you and help "],["153.2","us remain focused on you "],["155.12","so thank you for your blessings thank "],["156.64","you for this time and it's in jesus name "],["158.72","we pray "],["160.239","amen all right so "],["165.04","this christmas story it starts "],["168.08","before the world starts "],["171.2","or before had any meaning except that "],["174.64","they had no meaning so was it really "],["176.319","before "],["177.2","and did it actually ever start "],["181.04","okay great greg confuse everyone right "],["183.2","out of the gate thanks for that "],["184.48","well you're welcome um you see the story "],["187.2","starts "],["188.08","in eternity past except in eternity "],["192.08","there is no past as best i can figure "],["194.8","but for the sake of our discussion "],["196.72","we're going to call it eternity past and "],["199.519","this story "],["200.239","starts before the earth and even the "],["202.959","heavens "],["203.76","were even things "],["206.799","okay genesis 1 1 tells us that in the "],["209.92","beginning "],["210.799","god created the heavens and the earth so "],["213.84","at one "],["215.68","point for a lack of another term there "],["218.319","was no "],["219.04","heaven as we think of it but "],["222.72","there always was the word of god "],["226.08","who we now call jesus the son of god "],["229.76","john 1 verses 1 through 3 says in the "],["232.879","beginning was the word "],["235.519","and the word was with god and the word "],["238.319","was god "],["239.28","he was in the beginning with god all "],["241.439","things came into being through him "],["244.159","and apart from him nothing came into "],["246","being that has ever come into being "],["249.36","so all things that came into being "],["252.959","came through him the word of god jesus "],["256.4","christ "],["256.88","question logically "],["262.4","can something create itself "],["265.6","no it cannot thus "],["268.96","the word did not come into being "],["273.68","but rather always was he is not the "],["276.72","first "],["277.12","angel or something like that "],["280.24","he is part of the one true god "],["283.44","a personality of the creator godhead "],["288.639","you are the lord you alone "],["292.08","you have made heaven the heavens of "],["294.84","heavens with all their hosts "],["297.44","the earth and all that is on it the seas "],["300.4","and "],["300.72","all that is in them and you preserve all "],["303.36","of them "],["304.479","and the host of heaven worships "],["307.68","you the lord made all of the hosts "],["311.199","of heaven "],["314.639","john already said they were made through "],["316.96","the word "],["318.32","so again this all comes before "],["321.36","before when all created beings "],["326","whether in heaven or on earth were "],["328.479","created "],["329.12","at the start when the word start "],["331.919","actually becomes a concept becomes a "],["333.6","thing

gave us uniforms so we "],["171.92","were on the team in that "],["173.36","sense so we were kind of like the "],["175.12","practice squad so we sat at the end of "],["176.879","the bench

"],["184.8","that what we would do is we would "],["186.239","reenact "],["187.2","whatever we saw on the court so if one "],["189.68","of our players made a great play he and "],["191.68","i would

year they "],["234.239","wrapped up navair and crystal city and "],["235.76","schlepped everybody down here "],["237.84","and so began to make that trek on an "],["240.08","occasional basis my boss "],["241.92","the owner of the company actually moved "],["243.439","an entire office of 30 plus people down "],["245.92","here "],["246.959","one desk at a time in the back of his

"],["264.08","there weren't even traffic lights down "],["265.52","here "],["266.32","so it's come a long way but i do "],["268.24","remember passing by this church "],["270.639","matter of fact

here uh "],["281.52","through you blessing you with rob "],["284.8","and ileana leading you and just it's "],["287.199","it's just neat to see "],["289.04","what god has done particularly "],["291.919","encouraged by your investment in "],["293.52","missions not just "],["294.8","around the world but actually here in "],["296.72","your neighborhood "],["298.16","you've heard reference

we appreciate you ministering to "],["320","them i want to begin "],["321.44","uh this morning by taking a look at "],["324.56","um if i can get this to work whoops "],["327.759","go back one ah i can't see it there "],["332.88","uh matthew chapter 18 you don't have to "],["335.6","look it up it's here on the screen "],["337.44","in front of you jesus is talking he says "],["340","this he says what do you think "],["341.68","if a man has a hundred sheep and one of "],["343.52","them goes astray "],["345.28","doesn't he does he leave does he not "],["347.199","leave the 99 on the mountains "],["349.199","go in search of the one that went astray "],["351.6","and if he finds it truly i say to you he "],["354","rejoices over it more "],["355.759","than over the 99 that never went astray "],["359.039","so it's not the will of my father who's "],["361.68","in heaven "],["362.72","that one of these little ones should "],["364.84","perish "],["366.4","so i know you're good students of

is I'd like "],["33.66","to say thank you to this church "],["35.989","we came here about I'm gonna get choked "],["38.61","up now already anyways we came here "],["41.16","about three years ago um for those of "],["43.02","you don't know me I'm in the Navy I'm a "],["45.03","master-at-arms in the Navy for you army "],["47.1","people on military police so we came "],["50.04","here about three years ago and we were "],["52.949","looking for a church and in this area "],["55.35","and being the military we had a little "],["56.7","bit of a hard time took us about a year "],["57.899","and a half to find this wonderful family "],["61.61","now if you notice I call it a family if "],["65.009","that's what you guys have been to my "],["66.21","family "],["67.52","there are some of you that you'd call "],["69.66","uncles and aunts there's some of you "],["72.479","that you might even call my son might "],["74.009","even call grandma or grandpa "],["75.979","but it's because of how you've been such "],["78.899","a family to my family in the middle of "],["82.17","August I'll be taking off and I'll be "],["83.88","shipping out but my wife and son will be "],["85.92","staying here and one of the things that "],["87.959","I'm not worried about is that they won't "],["89.459","have help and it's because of you guys "],["91.53","the ministry that you've all had in our "],["93.869","lives that is something very important "],["96.81","to a military member we are far away "],["99.569","from our home we are sacrificing so much "],["102.39","for people and it's really encouraging "],["105.3","to know that there's a community there "],["107.33","helping us supporting us and helping our "],["111.06","families out so thank you to this church "],["113.039","that second item of business you're "],["115.44","probably gonna notice if you know my son "],["117.09","I'll be honest he's a very energetic "],["118.92","child he gets that from me I can't sit "],["122.49","still so you're gonna probably feel like "],["124.5","you're at a tennis match if you're "],["125.7","working a camera I apologize now because "],["127.679","you're not the follow me all right the "],["130.89","other part with with the way I'm "],["132.42","preaching today is as you can see I have "],["134.819","one slide up the rest of it is going to "],["137.7","be on your guys's shoulders whether "],["139.23","you're at home or here I'm gonna ask you "],["142.05","to take notes I'm gonna ask you to be a "],["143.88","part of the sermon today so if you feel "],["147.27","a need to say Amen you feel a me too hey "],["150.269","raise the hand ask a question I'll "],["151.95","answer it it won't throw me off I "],["153.78","promise I encourage your participation "],["156.44","so that being said let's look at the "],["159.599","context of our sermon today I'm a firm "],["162.569","believer in the context that you have to "],["163.95","ask the who what's when's where's and "],["165.51","why but today we're gonna answer only a "],["167.4","few of those we're gonna answer the who "],["168.66","the what the when and the why so the "],["171.81","first question we come up to is the who "],["173.52","who wrote the book of Romans Oh problem "],["176.94","already if you look at the screen it "],["178.08","says John 3:16 and 17 that's going to be "],["180.989","our final destination today today we are "],["183.15","taking a road trip along the Romans Road "],["185.15","alright so before we get into that I "],["188.28","promise that I'm gonna give you all "],["189.93","every single reference where I'm "],["192.239","preaching from where I'm talking from so "],["194.4","that you have enough time to write it "],["195.81","down okay "],["197.09","that being said the context of who wrote "],["200.549","the book of Romans well Paul wrote the "],["202.2","book of Romans to the early Christians "],["203.819","living in Rome though what well many "],["207.39","biblical scholars believe that the book "],["209.1","of Romans gives the clearest teaching on "],["211.489","Christian doctrine so what is Christian "],["214.47","doctrine basically Christian doctrine is "],["216.87","understanding what you believe in how "],["219.87","you became a Christian and then not only "],["222.06","having a religion but having a "],["224.4","relationship with God and that's what I "],["226.92","want to key on with you guys today a lot "],["229.44","of you maybe you're like me maybe you've "],["230.91","been a Christian for a little while and "],["232.44","you're like you know what Ben I got that "],["233.7","down I already have a relationship with "],["235.829","Christ well that's awesome way to go "],["238.079","I'll give you a home applause great job "],["239.85","what are you doing with it "],["242.15","are you telling others about it are you "],["245.549","serving in the ministry in some way are "],["247.98","you helping out what are you doing with "],["250.89","it and hopefully going through the "],["252.69","Romans wrote a will give you a tool to "],["255.239","be able to help people that might not "],["256.89","know who Christ is to introduce them to "],["259.35","who Christ is "],["261.049","so that's the what the when the book of "],["264.84","Romans was written 60 years after the "],["267.12","Beth the death burial and resurrection "],["269.07","of Christ and lastly the why it's a "],["273.03","how-to guide to be a Christian a road "],["276.21","map if you will to get from lost to "],["278.55","found to get out of sin and into glory "],["283.28","so this group of verses is actually very "],["286.86","special to me when I was 12 years old it "],["290","was this group of verses actually led me "],["291.92","to the Lord and this is what I mean so "],["294.74","growing up I grew up in Manchester New "],["296.3","Hampshire which is almost as far north "],["298.91","as you can get New England besides Maine "],["301.7","and there are two things that my father "],["304.73","and I really got along on that we never "],["306.71","argued about two things I'm probably "],["308.33","gonna polarize you guys right now first "],["310.55","one was the New England Patriots "],["312.31","thank you the second one was soccer "],["316.3","those are the two things that my father "],["318.68","and I completely and totally agreed on "],["320.45","was one Sunday afternoon in October and "],["323.36","if you guys have ever been to New "],["325.13","England it's a lot like Maryland in the "],["327.83","fall where the ground will fall and "],["329.75","freeze and thaw and freeze and if you've "],["333.41","ever tried to play football or soccer on "],["335.48","ground that does AG it's very squishy "],["337.13","and mushy so my father was playing in a "],["340.22","game that afternoon and that's how the "],["342.29","ground was so he put extra long studs in "],["344.71","his shoes at this time so that he could "],["347.27","keep traction cuz see the key in soccer "],["350.21","is if you're small like my father in me "],["352.04","short "],["353.26","speed helps you out traction helps you "],["356.06","out so he wanted to be able to do the "],["358.4","best that he could that's how he taught "],["359.75","me to play and that's how he played so "],["362.69","my job this day was I was a ball boy "],["364.16","that is the best job for any hyperactive "],["367.07","child going to watch a soccer game just "],["368.57","have him be the ball boy have him run up "],["370.13","and down the sideline and shag the balls "],["371.39","right so I'm watching my dad play as I'm "],["373.97","shagging balls on the other end of the "],["375.29","field and "],["376.419","it was in the second half of the game "],["380.05","remember the grounds all mushy and torna "],["382.69","my father was running streaking down the "],["386.18","sideline he got past the defender and "],["389.54","the midfielder saw him and gave him a "],["391.7","ball just sent it into the corner my dad "],["394.31","went streaking after it "],["396.07","the ball bounced and he came up and he "],["398.81","looked up and you opened his chest to be "],["400.28","able to catch the ball on his chest and "],["401.51","drop it to his foot and as he planted "],["403.97","that one foot guess who caught up to him "],["406.419","that defender the defender was going for "],["409.58","the ball and he hit my father at the "],["411.11","same time "],["412.48","from my father's kneecap up rotated 180 "],["417.38","degrees "],["418.84","now those of you who me cook probably "],["422.52","taking seller before and snapped it like "],["424.95","the whole bunch of celery that's exactly "],["427.56","what it sounded eighty yards away and "],["429.24","then I heard the second sound that still "],["431.7","sends chills up my spine I heard my "],["434.28","father for the first time when I cry out "],["436.02","in pain because he tore his ACL MCL TCL "],["439.05","and whatever other Cl he added his knee "],["441.3","was shot

that saving knowledge is "],["505.95","realizing that the Catholic Church "],["507.27","wasn't the church for his family so he "],["509.79","pulled us out and brought us to a church "],["511.32","with a youth pastor and a youth group "],["514.28","and I was right at that cusp age where I "],["517.56","might be a little young for youth group "],["519.69","but a little too old for the kids "],["521.19","programs so the youth pastor said you "],["523.289","know what you can come to the youth "],["525.3","group you just can't go on any of our "],["526.68","trips yet you're just not old enough to "],["528.27","do the overnight trips like cool that's "],["530.55","fine so I was there and then this one "],["533.22","trip came up that I really wanted to go "],["534.93","to it was called

grabbed a permission "],["570.68","slip behind the youth pastors back at "],["572.33","the time and I went home and my parents "],["575.33","looked at it and all my dad asked is "],["576.83","well are you old enough I said dad I'm "],["578.48","in the 7th grade I'm in youth group they "],["581.33","went okay he signed it brought it to "],["584.48","youth group that week getting ready to "],["585.95","go "],["587.11","my youth pastor at the time his name is "],["589.31","Dick Kern's looks at me and goes "],["591.19","are you old enough I said yep I'm old "],["594.5","enough I figured I'm in the seventh "],["595.91","grade I'm old enough let's go so he was "],["599.72","kind and gracious because he probably "],["601.28","knew I wasn't and he let me go anyways "],["603.43","but see the word of life Super Bowls a "],["605.54","little sneaky and this is what I mean by "],["607.61","that they have all this fun stuff and "],["610.27","then they have an evangelist come and "],["613.18","this evangelist is on fire he makes me "],["616.22","look calm believe it or not he is there "],["618.89","and he captures you he grabs you he "],["620.6","pulls you in and you can see the word "],["622.61","pictures that he's painting and it was "],["624.32","just amazing and he used the Romans Road "],["627.86","and I heard the message and I went on "],["631.1","that trip with him and I responded and I "],["634.13","became a Christian "],["636.43","it was all because my dad had an "],["638.72","accident my youth pastor was gracious "],["641.45","enough which by the way you have a child "],["643.82","in the youth group you need to thank "],["645.14","mikaël joy cuz he does an amazing job "],["646.82","here and that's not just blowing smoke "],["650.24","that's the truth you don't believe me "],["651.71","show up when they started doing youth "],["653.15","group again and see how much work in "],["655.04","preparation he does it's amazing I "],["657.13","still don't know how you do that in this "],["659.06","the same time brother it blows me away "],["661.36","so "],["663.16","because that youth pastor took grace I "],["666.26","was able to go God worked it out and I "],["669.11","became a Christian age of 12 "],["671.47","so we're gonna look at the Romans Road "],["673.78","this group of verses is a great tool not "],["677.06","only to bring someone to Christ but it's "],["679.88","also a road map or rather a navigation "],["683.33","app for those of you that don't know "],["684.44","what a road map is and instead of Siri "],["687.02","it's Paul "],["688.48","so we're going to look at our first "],["690.47","verse today this is our starting out "],["691.97","point our beginning point Romans chapter "],["694.4","3 verse 23 so if you have your Bible and "],["696.59","encourage you to open up to it if you "],["698.87","got a piece of paper write the reference "],["700.28","down you guys need to be like my Berean "],["702.44","church if I say something that's wrong I "],["704.12","expect somebody to come up and tell me "],["705.41","afterwards I know at least one person "],["707.36","that will I'm looking at him right now I "],["708.77","know he's got my back but I'm gonna ask "],["710.96","you guys to do that for me okay I'm "],["712.85","encouraging you to do you know why "],["714.58","there's a reason why God is mentioned "],["716.84","the Berean Church multiple times in the "],["718.61","New Testament because they were engaged "],["720.92","they were active they were there they "],["724.31","didn't do it out of a malice or out of "],["726.35","her pride they did it because they loved "],["728.51","the person that was teaching you guys "],["730.43","coming up to me after this service not "],["732.02","just something hey you did a great job "],["733.31","and I say to you praise God but hey you "],["735.86","might want to work on this next time "],["737.12","that helps me out that helps me develop "],["740.12","my gift that God has given me because "],["742.46","trust me if this is just me doing this "],["744.53","I'd be stuttering I'd be all over the "],["746.54","place more so than I am now it's because "],["748.58","of God that I'm able to do this not "],["750.02","because of anything that I can do and "],["751.37","that's why this Romans Road is so "],["753.35","important because it puts the key on who "],["755.24","God is versus where you're at so Romans "],["759.17","3:23 it says in Romans chapter 3 verse "],["762.86","23 for all have sinned and fall short of "],["765.41","the glory of God you notice how Paul "],["767.72","offers a very clear reminder here that "],["770.06","every human being has sinned and no one "],["774.08","can live up to God's standard you see "],["776.93","it's our sin yours and mine that "],["779.24","separates us from God so what is that "],["782.45","what is sin I'm gonna ask you guys some "],["784.67","questions to get involved make sure "],["785.87","you're still awake okay how many of you "],["789.1","have taken cookies when you were a child "],["791.57","even though your mom told you not to "],["793.22","raise your hand okay here's another one "],["796.07","for you this one might hit a little bit "],["797.15","home all right "],["798.91","2:35 has a posted speed limit right how "],["802.49","many of you have gone past a speed limit "],["805.1","on to 35 "],["808","I'm in law enforcement and I've done it "],["810.83","alright so trust me I'm not I don't got "],["812.99","it all down "],["814.09","well you know what those are those C "],["816.11","minor infractions right that's still sin "],["819.31","you see God doesn't see it difference "],["821.779","between a minor infraction and something "],["824","that we considered a major like murder "],["826.19","stealing God doesn't see a difference "],["828.98","all he sees is sin and to God sin is sin "],["833.42","now here's the kicker about it if you "],["835.61","keep following Pastor as he goes through "],["837.32","study of Luke you're gonna hear Christ "],["839.6","teach about if you think it you've done "],["842.029","it so you might not really do it you "],["844.88","might just think about it how many you "],["847.339","guys have road rage when you're driving "],["848.54","you get cut off and not the most "],["850.459","Christian thoughts enter your head right "],["852.17","you might not go out there and do what "],["854.089","you're thinking but you still thought it "],["857.329","that's still sin and it's that sin that "],["861.019","separates you from God so what is that "],["864.649","separation it's a separation from the "],["866.899","physical presence of God "],["869.259","I've heard a lot of military members say "],["872.69","that we are currently in hell now or not "],["876.73","because if you look around and you see "],["879.019","the trees you see people you see the "],["881.329","animals that's God's presence do you "],["884.3","know why I say that because he created "],["886.16","it that's his thumbprint on creation "],["888.529","he's been here he's here "],["891.37","there's only one place that he's not and "],["894.62","that is hell and that's where you go you "],["897.769","get separated from the physical presence "],["900.529","of God so "],["903.819","we saw in Romans 3:23 Aalesund everybody "],["907.699","assent Romans 6:23 says this Romans 6:23 "],["912.98","for the wages of sin is death but the "],["916.88","gift of God is eternal life in Christ "],["919.339","our Lord "],["920.92","see a wage is something that you learn "],["923.41","right you have a job you work 40 hours a "],["926.63","week you get a paycheck that's your wage "],["928.699","if you're in school and you study as "],["931.73","hard as you can for a test and you get "],["933.649","an a on that test or an a on that paper "],["935.87","that's your wage for the amount of work "],["937.639","you put in if you were like me and "],["939.8","trying to make some extra money you go "],["942.5","next door to your neighbor's house mow "],["943.939","their lawn and hopefully you get some "],["945.529","money but more times than not I got "],["947.3","cookies those cookies where's my wage "],["949.459","that's what I made I earned that that "],["953.149","was something that I did to get "],["954.62","something so Paul says our wage for sin "],["958.31","is death that separation that I was "],["961.01","talking to you about "],["962.98","well that's not where this verse ends it "],["966.38","goes on to say that the gift of God is "],["970.779","eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord "],["973.87","well a gift is given it's not what we've "],["977.75","earned it's not even what we deserve you "],["980.72","see a job you do something to earn "],["982.25","something you do something to get it a "],["983.99","gift is just given to you how many of "],["986.27","you love Christmas "],["987.91","like I love Christmas now I could tell "],["991.88","you the pulpit answer why I love "],["993.529","Christmas okay that was cuz of Christ's "],["996.26","birth it's because we get to be together "],["998.6","and we get to worship Him and we get to "],["1000.279","do all that lovely stuff but that's not "],["1001.93","what I'm gonna tell you right now I'm "],["1003.1","gonna tell you my very selfish reason "],["1004.69","why I love Christmas I get gifts I love "],["1008.2","getting gifts because I didn't do "],["1010.3","anything to get it "],["1011.7","you see that responsibility of getting "],["1014.529","that gift wasn't it on me that "],["1016.23","responsibility was on the person who "],["1018.1","went out to the store who made the money "],["1019.57","to purchase the gift and then decided "],["1021.52","hey you know what I like you so much I'm "],["1022.99","gonna give this to you I did not do "],["1025.3","anything to get that gift "],["1027.089","that's exactly what salvation is and "],["1029.65","that's why Paul uses that terminology a "],["1031.66","wage and a gift your wage is what you've "],["1034.39","earned you've earned

alright cool so "],["1056.46","that's why Paul uses that there's "],["1059.65","nothing that we can do to earn it or pay "],["1061.75","for "],["1062.88","God has taken that responsibility in "],["1066.01","Romans five verse eight Romans five "],["1069.28","verse 8 God demonstrates his love love "],["1072.79","towards us and that while we were still "],["1075.04","sinners Christ died for

sit at a light and I watch "],["1113.58","this blinking light have you ever seen "],["1116.1","the movie cars and you see the two cars "],["1117.78","that are sitting in the middle of town "],["1118.86","and they're watching the light go from "],["1120","yellow to another color back to yellow "],["1122.52","that's how I feel most of my day "],["1124.82","but I sit there because guess what "],["1126.99","happens on the weekend the lights go "],["1130.47","from a normal light to a flashing red "],["1132","light so I'm gonna ask you guys a "],["1133.2","question please feel free to answer what "],["1135.6","are you supposed to do at a flashing red "],["1136.98","light do you think people stop no so "],["1141.87","that's why I sit there so I sit at this "],["1144.84","light and you go through gate one you "],["1147.179","say hi to the gate guard you're nice to "],["1148.74","them and you say thank you they say yep "],["1150.39","okay go your way I know they're they're "],["1153.12","not always the nicest they're bored too "],["1155.66","you go through and you're going on your "],["1158.01","day and it might not be paying attention "],["1159.48","and too late you notice you didn't stop "],["1161.4","at that light because you wanna know how "],["1162.69","I know it's too late because you see my "],["1164.79","blue lights coming up behind you "],["1166.79","so I come up behind you and I pull you "],["1169.11","over and I introduce myself I say hello "],["1172.83","my name is officer ball and ran with the "],["1174.33","packs or police department the reason "],["1175.65","why I pulled you over today is because "],["1176.82","you didn't stop at that red flashing "],["1178.14","light is there a reason why you want to "],["1180.66","know the one answer I never got because "],["1182.94","I just wanted to see your lovely face "],["1184.14","and say hi I have never gotten that "],["1186.96","answer I get all I didn't see it or "],["1189.78","sometimes my

"],["1200.85","usually is sir ma'am I don't care I just "],["1204.57","want your license and registration I'll "],["1205.98","be back in a minute could you imagine if "],["1208.2","Christ did that to us with salvation "],["1211.13","think about that "],["1214.34","even when we were disrespecting him "],["1217.559","we've all been disrespected in some way "],["1219.99","somehow in our life right

all over the "],["79.58","world so without further ado welcoming "],["82.88","this morning our missionaries to "],["84.229","Indonesia Eric and Hannah Bell give him "],["86.599","a big hand "],["87.5","oh good morning middle school days and "],["97.31","floppy hair that's what an intro it's "],["101.209","not the good old days for me those were "],["102.77","kind of awkward so we'll just ignore "],["104.63","that as pastor Robb mentioned we're "],["107.149","missionaries Indonesia it's up there "],["109.599","Hannah will come up in a little bit we "],["112.13","have three kids now obviously that "],["114.38","wasn't the case in middle school "],["117.22","Chloe Grace and Karis they are now two "],["119.959","four and five they're downstairs we'll "],["122.899","probably have them later join us at the "],["125.09","potluck this church has been a part of "],["126.89","our journey since before we even "],["128.3","officially joined MAF so there's a lot "],["130.67","of history here well we're just honored "],["133.76","to be here it's great to be back and we "],["135.98","just want to share a few things with you "],["137.18","today for those of you that haven't met "],["139.67","us we're excited to be able to introduce "],["141.8","ourselves to you and hopefully get to "],["143.81","meet you and talk to you afterwards so "],["146.18","we serve with mission aviation "],["147.709","fellowship or MAF in the country of "],["150.98","Indonesia and Indonesia is "],["153.54","a country made up of thousands of little "],["155.969","islands right on the equator in between "],["158.159","Australia and Asia and the Pacific Ocean "],["160.29","there and to give you an idea of the "],["161.969","scale it's about as wide as the US is a "],["164.849","lot of the islands are very small but "],["166.53","the island that we live and work on is "],["167.939","roughly the size of the state of Texas "],["170.37","so there are some some very large "],["172.739","islands and that's where we serve I work "],["175.379","as a pilot mechanic which means that I "],["177.569","both fly and I maintain the aircraft "],["179.67","that we use to support missionaries and "],["182.519","local churches in their outreach "],["184.489","primarily we work in these very hard to "],["186.93","reach or remote inaccessible places we "],["191.069","also do medevac flights because when "],["193.079","you're thinking about people in these "],["194.43","very remote villages there's no medical "],["196.29","care and so if there's anything very "],["198.569","serious we help provide them "],["200.43","transportation to a larger area where "],["202.47","they can receive that care for medevac "],["204.9","flights for me so far I haven't been "],["206.849","doing this very long but I've seen "],["208.5","everything from complicated child births "],["210.84","to AIDS and tuberculosis patients people "],["214.62","having been shot by an arrow you name it "],["217.799","it's probably already happened so "],["219.479","there's a lot of need out there for that "],["221.69","MAF also helps with disaster relief we "],["224.459","have a team I think they're wrapping up "],["226.379","now from the Bahamas most recent "],["228.15","hurricane we go there Haiti half the "],["231.06","earthquake and may have sent teams there "],["233.04","to help basically them rebuild and "],["235.709","survive and start their life again later "],["239.4","on we'll give a little more details on "],["240.84","what we actually do but I have the "],["242.909","opportunity today to kind of share with "],["244.409","you guys something that was very "],["245.459","impactful on me because when I grew up I "],["248.25","didn't really know what a missionary was "],["249.87","they came through town kind of blitzed "],["252.239","in and out and that was it I had no clue "],["254.639","what they were actually doing most of "],["256.289","the time or why there was really a need "],["258.389","I mean you can serve people here you can "],["260.729","serve people there was the difference so "],["262.919","one of the things I want to do is kind "],["264.06","of bring you guys an awareness of some "],["266.07","of the things that drew us into doing "],["268.169","this full-time so let's start by "],["270.33","imagining this with me there's an entire "],["272.19","village an entire race or people group "],["274.47","that are born they struggle to go "],["277.86","through life and then they pass away no "],["280.83","one in their village has ever heard the "],["282.12","name of Jesus there's no way for any of "],["285.479","them to hear the name of Jesus because "],["286.77","they have "],["287.28","Bible they have no missionary there and "],["289.68","it's it's really hard to fathom right "],["292.56","we have billboards going down the "],["294.6","highway with Jesus loves you there's "],["297.389","church signs you can go to a church you "],["299.19","can ask Siri you have the phone on your "],["301.41","Bible I mean that there's no way no "],["303.87","excuse really for us to say well I never "],["306.33","really had the chance to know who God "],["308.22","was because we're surrounded by it "],["310.2","that's our culture that's some of the "],["312.26","you might say privileges that we get of "],["314.79","living in such a nation as America and "],["316.889","that's awesome but for those people what "],["320.85","is it's almost the entire opposite right "],["322.71","it's hopeless there's no hope for them "],["325.55","but the thing that I want to draw our "],["328.56","attention to is that there there is "],["329.88","potentially hope for them in Revelation "],["332.82","7 starting in verse 9 there's a throne "],["335.19","room scene and it says after this I "],["337.62","looked and behold a great multitude that "],["340.53","no one could number from every nation "],["342.06","from all tribes peoples and languages "],["344.61","standing before the throne and before "],["346.889","the lamb clothed in white Rome ropes "],["349.74","with palm branches in their hands crying "],["352.38","out with a loud voice salvation belongs "],["354.51","to our God who sits on the throne and to "],["356.55","the lamb "],["357.69","amen what a pretty song right and this "],["360.6","scene is yet to come we haven't seen "],["361.979","this yet this is in the final days but "],["364.8","what it says to us is that every people "],["366.99","group will eventually be represented in "],["369.87","front of Christ so there is a hope but "],["373.86","here's the rub the dilemma to this is "],["375.479","that until people from each one of those "],["377.55","groups is exposed to and has a chance to "],["380.37","respond to the gospel every single one "],["383.19","of them will go through life and die "],["385.1","without that opportunity they will "],["387.93","literally go to hell because no one has "],["390.539","ever been there and told them about "],["392.07","Christ Romans 10 kind of explains this "],["396.75","it says for everyone who calls upon the "],["398.22","name of the Lord will be saved how then "],["400.62","will they call on him whom they have not "],["402.3","believed how are they to believe in him "],["404.91","of whom they have never heard where in "],["408.09","Romans 10 just if I hear a couple pages "],["410.76","turning you can kind of see where this "],["413.58","is going how will they hear without "],["414.93","someone preaching and how are they to "],["416.97","preach unless they are sent "],["418.889","a little further on Paul says so faith "],["420.629","comes by hearing and hearing through the "],["422.49","word of Christ what we would consider "],["424.499","the Bible or the Scriptures so that "],["426.93","leaves us with with what people around "],["429.3","the world that have to hear the gospel "],["431.159","to believe but they can't and they "],["434.34","cannot come to faith and that that right "],["436.59","there that's the sticking point when I "],["438.449","was going through for me it was college "],["440.279","and I learned about all of this that's "],["441.96","what drew me and Hannah as well to want "],["444.719","to go do something about this so when I "],["447.9","say the words tribal missionary what do "],["450.749","you guys picture or think of start "],["453.33","calling out locations images what do you "],["455.939","get when you hear the words tribal "],["457.289","missionary anybody remote are we "],["465.12","thinking like big cities naked people "],["468.9","yeah "],["472.099","dangerous huts we kind of have like this "],["476.4","National Geographic picture right we've "],["479.52","all seen those pictures or the news "],["480.99","documentaries and we have a video we'll "],["484.139","show you later basically exactly the "],["486.629","same thing so we know what this looks "],["488.61","like right we know what that we can "],["491.279","picture a Stone Age tribe we can picture "],["493.139","a primitive village and for me at now my "],["498.389","new kind of version of this is a tribal "],["500.399","missionary is usually a bearded guy "],["502.469","sitting barefoot on a floor you know huh "],["505.11","teaching the guys there from his newly "],["508.199","translated scriptures that he's been "],["509.52","working on the last few years I've seen "],["512.31","that that's what it looks like but the "],["516.36","thing that I didn't realized was what's "],["518.519","behind him for him to sit there and "],["520.62","teach what does it take so starting in "],["523.62","the tribe and working backwards "],["524.959","typically there's a husband-and-wife "],["527.79","team typically several teams and if you "],["530.88","know missionaries they have a lot of "],["532.649","kids they also use computers technology "],["536.64","to record the language to decipher to "],["540.12","interpret to translate and so they need "],["542.399","a tech team to help maintain those "],["544.5","programs and develop software for that "],["546.12","they need transportation to and from the "],["548.399","tribe some of the places that we go to "],["551.91","several weeks of travel by canoe only or "],["554.46","a flow plane which is what we use "],["557.69","transportation to and from medical care "],["560.01","either for emergencies or just routine "],["562.56","stuff and they need finances to keep "],["565.32","them there and they really need prayer "],["567.6","as well spiritual texts are very real "],["570.39","and they can be very heavy in the US so "],["573.21","still thinking of that guy out in the "],["574.68","tribe in the US there's an entire team "],["577.38","here right there's finance department "],["579.42","there's people to do their taxes there's "],["581.19","all these little details that we have to "],["582.86","get right in this modern world or we "],["585.72","just can't survive and can't do our work "],["587.94","we could basically take this ad nauseum "],["591.12","until we were all bored and I'm a nerd "],["593.7","so I like that stuff but we won't do "],["595.08","that today so let's let's go to the "],["598.68","Bible to see this idea as the body of "],["601.83","Christ and first Corinthians 12 it's "],["604.56","describing the the body of Christ here "],["606.6","so I'm going to kind of jump through the "],["608.31","patch passage starting in verse 4 "],["610.47","through at least 27 so I'll just kind of "],["613.53","read out a few of those it says there "],["615.42","are a variety of gifts but the same "],["617.04","spirit there are varieties of service "],["619.68","but the same Lord there are varieties of "],["622.26","activities but it is the same God who "],["624.48","empowers them all in every one in verse "],["627.78","12 he says for just as the body is one "],["629.58","and has many members and all the members "],["632.37","of the body though many are one body so "],["634.86","it is with Christ again this is kind of "],["637.11","that team concept verse 27 now you are "],["640.86","the body of Christ and individually "],["642.27","members of it are all apostles are all "],["645.84","prophets are all teachers do all work "],["649.08","miracles and Paul continues this list I "],["651.95","love this passage why because it says "],["656.67","that I don't have to become pastor up "],["659.12","I'm not supposed to I'm not gifted the "],["662.28","way he is if we were to switch Rob and "],["664.44","Suzanne how well do you think this "],["666.69","church would work they are both "],["669.75","fantastic at what they do and they are "],["672.51","in their places and that's where they're "],["674.82","meant to be if I was probably either one "],["678.36","of them I'd go crazy and God doesn't "],["680.4","require me to push my way into a gift "],["682.38","that's not mine that he hasn't given me "],["685.24","I want to acknowledge that God will call "],["688.54","us to things that aren't always "],["689.709","comfortable so please don't hear this as "],["691.72","an advocate of just stay in your comfort "],["694.449","zone and that's where God wants you "],["695.679","because that's not true and we can "],["697.779","attest to that that he will remove you "],["700.059","out of there very forcibly if that's "],["701.709","what you're trying to do "],["702.519","but what I am saying is that God makes "],["704.8","each of us differently and that's okay "],["707.189","we can use what he's given us and "],["709.74","ultimately as a believer every single "],["712.24","one of us is called to live for Jesus "],["713.559","and to do everything for the glory of "],["716.17","God Paul again says that in first "],["718.959","Corinthians and that's partly why I'm so "],["721.449","encouraged by what I see from this "],["722.709","church you guys are involved in the "],["724.54","mission you send teams to Haiti there's "],["727.029","people overseas that you're involved "],["728.529","with you guys been supporting us before "],["730.48","we even even signed up with MAF each one "],["734.019","of those ministries is different and you "],["735.639","could not take personnel and swap them "],["738.009","you could just like switch in pastor Rob "],["739.6","and Suzanne you could not swap me and "],["741.699","probably another one of our missionaries "],["743.259","and be very effective ministries look "],["746.11","different they feel different they have "],["748.089","different techniques in our case they "],["750.04","smell different but the important thing "],["752.17","is that we each play our part that we're "],["754.629","called to and I just want to say how "],["757.779","proud I am of Erick when God pushes him "],["760.269","out of his comfort zone as a very "],["762.1","introverted person to stand up here and "],["763.839","to speak the truth oh thank you for "],["766.42","doing that "],["772.95","I just wanted to take a moment to and "],["775.44","reiterate what Eric was saying I have "],["779.13","just been so encouraged listening to the "],["782.25","praises and the prayer requests of you "],["784.5","guys in this church and all the things "],["786.72","that you are involved in and your heart "],["788.97","to just reach people in the community "],["792.089","and across the world and to let them "],["794.25","have that hope that you have hopefully "],["796.829","experienced in your own life and we want "],["799.62","to challenge you guys today in your idea "],["802.589","of what missions is that being a "],["806.19","missionary is not what we are we are not "],["809.49","missionaries in our own thoughts or that "],["813.329","typical bearded man I don't really have "],["815.459","a beard but just letting God use you to "],["820.41","help bring his kingdom down on the earth "],["822.959","I was reading that even just this "],["825.029","morning of just let your kingdom come on "],["828.12","earth as it is in heaven and that is our "],["831.75","mission that is our job is to have these "],["834.24","glimpses and these heavenly priorities "],["836.31","come and be a part of our everyday lives "],["838.74","and so I just want to applaud you guys "],["841.589","in the way that you're doing that in the "],["843.839","way that you are reaching out and "],["845.579","touching the hearts of others and I even "],["847.98","felt like we definitely had a piece of "],["849.99","the kingdom of heaven "],["851.01","today in this worship service of just "],["853.41","singing about this freedom that we have "],["855.529","it brings tears to my eyes just being so "],["859.11","excited about what God has done and how "],["861.63","he has worked in my own life and in the "],["863.88","life of this church and I just want to "],["866.01","say that I'm proud of you "],["867.149","and I'm honored to be here today and to "],["870.36","worship with you and to have this "],["872.64","freedom and that you guys are on board "],["875.55","with sharing that freedom with others "],["877.86","and to see that heavenly throne room "],["881.339","scene like Eric was talking about and "],["883.319","inviting people of other cultures and "],["885.72","other other life walks into that throne "],["888.329","room scene so that they can say free "],["890.93","free forever amen let's join the song of "],["898.17","the redeemed and I just want to applaud "],["899.85","that and you guys something that I love "],["902.67","about what we do is that it brings so "],["906.329","much "],["906.75","- Eric Eric is a great pilot he's a "],["909.329","great mechanic and he loves doing what "],["911.339","he does and it's exciting to me as a "],["913.889","wife to see my husband excelling at "],["916.079","something and to be able to use that for "],["918.269","God's glory and so we just want to "],["921.75","encourage you guys to find those things "],["923.61","that bring you joy and I'm still on that "],["926.129","journey as a wife of figuring out what "],["928.47","that looks like in my own life and we "],["931.139","have definitely failed things and we've "],["933.149","learned from things and it's exciting to "],["936.72","be a part of that process and to see it "],["938.819","in my own kids to see the things that "],["940.769","they're very good at and the things that "],["942.629","bring them joy and just talking they've "],["946.05","really liked talking I don't know where "],["947.579","they get it from probably Eric that's my "],["950.459","guess but to see them talk with their "],["953.339","friends and just automatically go to "],["955.199","Jesus as they're talking with their "],["957.48","Muslim friends and they're just talking "],["959.459","about what they're celebrating and the "],["961.92","things that they see in the yard and how "],["964.23","God made it and it's just exciting to "],["966.93","see our role in that and it's not this "],["969.959","burden and it's not this big call it's "],["972.899","just living life and fulfilling the joy "],["976.11","and the passions that God has put in "],["977.91","your own life and we are honored to be "],["980.97","living the life that we do because it "],["983.519","does bring us joy and Eric has a great "],["987.75","opportunity to link that tribal "],["992.309","missionary to a community so you have a "],["996.089","place for them to stay in our home when "],["997.92","they're in town to be able to buy "],["999.36","groceries for them to help bring them "],["1002","materials and solar batteries when "],["1006.41","things are falling apart that we can "],["1008.66","connect them and it's been a joy for us "],["1012.019","to be a part of that to see the Bible "],["1014.269","translated to see them learning "],["1015.86","languages to see them reaching those "],["1018.199","people and doing things that we haven't "],["1020.99","necessarily been called to do but that "],["1023.18","we can support it I could go on and on "],["1025.73","about all the things that we have seen "],["1027.079","an experienced over the last couple of "],["1028.49","years but we're strong believers in the "],["1030.409","power of media so we have a video for "],["1033.26","you guys so that you can get a glimpse "],["1035.24","of what our lives have looked like over "],["1036.919","the last 40 years "],["1037.909","enjoy "],["1049.78","[Applause]

rooting for us and "],["1523.3","praying for us it means the world to us "],["1526.24","and it's the only reason that we're "],["1528.52","ready to go back now is because of "],["1530.86","people like

(Guest Speaker Pastor Greg Ryan)","date":"2019-09-01","transcript":[["19.99","so this morning as I was trying to come "],["22.52","up with a theme for today's message "],["24.369","that's a joke yes I wrote this while ago "],["27.099","a couple of months ago actually during "],["33.8","one of the men's breakfast I I started a "],["35.75","series on the fruit of the spirit of "],["38.96","Galatians 5:22 and 23 and after talking "],["43.4","about the first element of the fruit "],["44.809","which is love I had to move on to the "],["48.079","next element which is joy and that's "],["51.409","where a problem arose I had committed to "],["56.09","doing a series on the fruit of the "],["58.55","Spirit because I had what I thought was "],["60.949","a pretty good two part lesson on love "],["65.38","unfortunately I hadn't thought beyond "],["67.67","that so when it came to talking about "],["69.259","joy "],["70.07","I had a rough estimate of zero idea of "],["74.509","where I was going to go with that so as "],["77.03","I struggled with this for a few days Rob "],["79.46","wanders into my office as Rob as want to "],["81.8","do and we started to talk about it "],["84.22","the main problem I was having was my "],["86.539","hook you know how sometimes he tells us "],["89.209","lovely little story I really couldn't "],["92.09","come up with him with one I told him "],["93.89","that the only thing I could come up with "],["95.69","was stuff that that happened to me stuff "],["98.69","that I seemed to always talk about and "],["101.63","use as an illustration and I told him "],["104.119","that I didn't want to dwell on the same "],["106.28","tired old story just to make it another "],["109.759","point and and that's where he stopped me "],["112.539","and he said Greg there are people here "],["115.91","who haven't heard it and even if they "],["117.83","have it's still your story you lived it "],["122.36","for a reason and then he left you know "],["125.149","drop the mic out the room busts out okay "],["128.179","but problem I was still having "],["132.319","reservations so that Friday I found "],["135.23","myself talking to uh Kevin Davis "],["137.45","downstairs I can't remember the exact "],["140.48","situation why we were all here on a "],["141.92","Friday but he started talking to me "],["144.47","about a project at work that he headed "],["146.33","up and he had to write a review for "],["148.219","every one who worked on that project and "],["150.079","when he presented it to his boss they "],["152.18","they said you know that's "],["153.62","and all but um what about you you worked "],["157.01","on the project why why didn't you write "],["159.409","about your performance and he told me "],["163.04","how hard he found that to be but in the "],["166.19","end I'm paradigm "],["168.65","you know summarizing he dropped this "],["171.53","little nugget on me he said sometimes "],["173","Greg to make your point you have to brag "],["175.79","on yourself a little bit and then he "],["178.34","left when I was yeah drop the mic "],["181.31","moments and he busted out I guess so "],["184.459","great again I guess that was what I was "],["187.19","gonna do get my exercise picking up my "],["190.459","pencil problem is I still really had no "],["194.06","idea what I was gonna talk about so that "],["195.709","night I regaled my wife with that "],["198.95","gripping tale I just regaled all of you "],["201.079","with and she asked me what my topic was "],["203.39","and I said joy and then she drops this "],["208.129","little bomb of a question on me what is "],["217.84","joy that's that that that's a really "],["222.62","good question I mean beautiful and smart "],["225.26","I mean is it really fair but you know "],["227.51","hey so I thought I'd look into this "],["230.72","little question apparently the lesson "],["234.079","turned out okay because a few of the "],["236.48","guys told me I should preach on this and "],["238.579","then and then Rob told he wasn't there "],["240.139","he was teaching a class up here but he "],["241.849","told me a couple other guys different "],["243.379","guys told him that I should preach on "],["245.75","this and so that's that's what I'm doing "],["251.359","now "],["252.889","so that's your backstory you're welcome "],["255.26","let's pray father God we just saw thank "],["258.139","you for bringing us into your house once "],["259.82","again we thank you for calling us to "],["261.56","this family we just thank you Lord for "],["263.889","the love the the the joy that you give "],["267.889","us we thank you for the support that you "],["269.81","give us we thank you for letting us know "],["271.669","that you hear our prayers and and today "],["273.8","Lord we want to listen to you we want to "],["275.84","hear your words and so we just ask you "],["277.52","God to be with us here spirit move among "],["280.25","us and just give us something from this "],["284.24","this morning Lord let us draw closer to "],["286.099","you and "],["287.63","just-just closer to who you you "],["290","originally meant us to be so we thank "],["291.95","you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen "],["295.55","all right back to the point what is joy "],["302.38","well luckily scripture tells us in "],["305.72","Nehemiah 8:10 he says the joy of the "],["310.52","Lord is your strength which didn't clear "],["316.91","a lot up for me so the question still "],["318.71","remains what is this joy especially when "],["321.02","you look at this section of scripture "],["322.46","these people nehemiah is speaking to are "],["325.4","in anguish they're wailing they're "],["328.82","crying because they've just been read "],["331.61","the law and they recognize their massive "],["335.57","sin they haven't been following it so "],["340.64","where's the joy so now I ask you a "],["344.3","question "],["345.55","when in anguish when in pain can you "],["350.63","have joy can you have joy in the chaos "],["353.65","or in chaos or in suffering does your "],["357.2","moodiness that comes in this storm "],["360.919","hover over everyone like a cloud not "],["363.44","that I'm suggesting that anyone should "],["365.18","ever be joyful about the storm that "],["369.169","anyone should ever be joyful about the "],["371","hard times but the question is can you "],["373.76","be joyful about the source of joy during "],["377.99","those hard times so I found a ton of "],["381.5","verses that talked about suffering for "],["384.41","the gospel "],["385.16","you know suffering persecution for your "],["387.26","Christian beliefs and being looked down "],["388.79","by by others and I honestly thought that "],["391.07","that was where I was going to go with "],["392.9","this you know I talked a little bit "],["395.09","about Paul and Silas singing hymns in "],["397.19","prison after be beaten severely and then "],["399.77","put in stocks and all that acts 16 22 to "],["402.65","26 if you want to look up that story but "],["405.68","sometimes as Christians we have to

testimony if you "],["467.81","will and I hope they can illustrate our "],["471.759","topic for today back in August of 1988 I "],["478.539","was 16 years old "],["481.21","gearing up for my senior year of "],["483.199","football after a less-than-stellar and "],["486.289","I'm being nice junior campaign when "],["489.259","suddenly my grandfather passed away I'm "],["492.44","gonna be reading this or we're gonna be "],["493.669","here for a long time so forgive me I "],["496.389","called myself a Christian at that time "],["499.509","but I had never read the Bible or "],["502.759","attended church so that was kind of a "],["506","weird claim about the only Christian "],["509.87","thing I did or understanding I had was "],["512.24","that I prayed at dinner time and I "],["514.13","prayed before I went to sleep that is it "],["516.289","but after grandpa's funeral I sat in my "],["520.88","bed one night and I prayed again but "],["524.39","this time I prayed a little bit "],["525.41","differently I asked God are you really "],["530.6","even there or have I been wasting my "],["534.5","time all these years amen "],["542.42","God for proof that he exists and I "],["546.05","stopped praying that was it I was done "],["550.16","until I got the proof and I am going to "],["553.76","be 100% honest with you things started "],["557.54","to go really well for me after that at "],["562.76","the start of football camp I learned "],["564.35","that I had lost out on a starting "],["566","position on offense to two of my friends "],["567.8","I was a split end and we older we were "],["570.68","the guys who ran the plays in and "],["572.36","everything so there were two starters so "],["575","at practice I was gonna be playing on "],["576.709","the scrub defense okay wait a minute "],["578.75","Greg I thought things went well yeah "],["580.339","hold on that's actually a good thing "],["582.769","so it sounds better you lost yeah it's "],["585.199","good okay so the story gets better we "],["588.769","ran a first and second team offense so "],["591.44","that takes 22 guys which only left nine "],["593.81","of us to play defense so it was 11 on "],["596.06","nine the whole time I was a defensive "],["598.55","end but at practice I could just line up "],["600.829","wherever I wanted on the defensive line "],["602.6","cuz I was a senior and I could tell the "],["604.76","juniors to move and so I lined up "],["606.769","wherever I wanted I was sometimes I was "],["609.199","a 6 foot 2 inch 165 pound nose tackle "],["613.279","anyone knows football you don't weigh "],["616.01","165 pounds and play nose tackle these "],["617.899","are your three hundred and fifty "],["619.07","pounders sometimes anyway I dominated "],["623.24","these practices I would sometimes go "],["627.079","through the line and grab the "],["628.13","quarterback before he could even hand "],["629.54","the ball off I mean I was doing really "],["633.949","well and the coaches took notice and our "],["637.97","first scrimmage of the year again I "],["640.55","Thomann ated around my and and off "],["643.55","tackle where I played the opposing team "],["645.86","didn't get to the line of scrimmage one "],["648.14","time they attempted five pass plays "],["651.05","while I was in on those plays I got two "],["653.42","sacks two assisted sacks which I got "],["656.18","there first but they were assisted sacks "],["658.699","and on the fifth play I hit the "],["661.49","quarterback just as he was going into "],["663.56","his throwing motion so the ball "],["665.089","fluttered harmlessly to the ground I "],["667.43","couldn't do anything again "],["670.04","the coaches took notice so much in fact "],["673.1","that that Monday I learned that they "],["675.5","were going to try to "],["676.339","get me on offense and I was going to "],["677.749","switch on and off with the backup tight "],["680.18","end on the second team defense Tuesday I "],["684.17","alternated on the first team offense "],["686.569","with the starting tight end and on "],["689.059","Wednesday I was the starting tight end I "],["692.139","had now earned the starting position on "],["695.42","offense and defense as well as on each "],["698.149","of the special teams I even got a "],["699.829","special spot on the kickoff team where "],["701.899","my job was just to run down the field "],["703.61","and knock over as many guys as possible "],["705.47","so someone else could make a tackle "],["708.639","that's fun "],["714.49","point is I was never going to leave the "],["717.41","field unless I wanted to get a drink and "],["719.689","I asked to come out I also learned from "],["722.809","the coaches that the Harrisburg paper "],["724.519","was doing features on athletes to watch "],["726.86","out for and that they were going to be "],["728.48","coming the next day to run a feature "],["730.519","article on me things were going very "],["734.499","very well since my decision to stop "],["738.589","praying now because it was picture day "],["743.24","that Wednesday practice was kind of "],["746.389","light in the morning so we could have "],["747.889","pictures in the afternoon and it had "],["749.54","rained all during practice in the "],["751.22","morning once it stopped raining we did a "],["754.16","couple of walkthroughs and then we got "],["756.439","our pictures taken and then we were sent "],["758.209","home seniors that night we're going to "],["761.36","get interviewed for the game program and "],["763.54","this year the interviews were to be done "],["765.92","at the interviewers house now every year "],["768.999","prior and every year since interviews "],["774.35","for the senior program have been done "],["776.569","over the phone but this year we had to "],["780.259","drive there I drove home ate something "],["785.509","real fast and then drove to town to get "],["787.1","my friend Chris he was supposed to be "],["789.769","waiting outside his house in town but he "],["791.99","wasn't and I looked around a little bit "],["793.99","through the truck into a part it was a "],["797.929","pickup truck ran in to get him came "],["802.879","running back out there sits my truck in "],["805.069","the middle of the road with now cars "],["806.75","sitting behind me they weren't happy "],["808.61","with me "],["809.91","so I jumped into the car and forgot to "],["813.03","put my seatbelt on I had taken it off to "],["815.55","go into the house I was the one who got "],["817.29","everybody wearing their seatbelts I got "],["819.66","back and didn't put it on that's gonna "],["821.31","come into play took off for God it had "],["827.43","been raining that morning there were "],["829.62","leaves it's fall there on the road "],["831.96","forgot about that they're gonna come "],["835.35","into play because you see Chris and I "],["837.93","weren't gonna make it to that interview "],["842.27","this is the last photo have taken me "],["846.96","before the accident that photo was taken "],["848.85","an hour before I wrecked when I woke up "],["854.25","I was surrounded by this bright light "],["857.12","with shadowy figures moving around me "],["859.92","and I heard muffled voices talking no I "],["862.44","was not in heaven "],["865.79","something was also choking me I later "],["869.43","learned that it was a breathing tube but "],["871.59","all I knew was that I wanted whatever it "],["873.63","was out of my throat so I tried to just "],["877.38","yank it out but when I did my arm went "],["880.34","and that was all I could get so that "],["884.76","wasn't gonna work so after a few more "],["886.83","tries I came up with a brilliant plan I "],["890.28","was gonna take my hand and try to go and "],["893.31","then crawl up my stomach with my thumb "],["896.67","until I could grab it and then just let "],["898.68","my arm go limp and yank it out of my "],["900.78","throat so here's the plan so I go one "],["903.84","two three now apparently the twitch was "],["909.12","enough that I suddenly heard a female "],["911.13","voice yell he's having seizures to which "],["918.18","I replied by whipping my head side to "],["921.42","side as if to say no I'm not and then I "],["925.32","heard a male voice who turned out to be "],["927.24","the anesthesiologist realizing he was "],["929.07","slacking off because I'm awake he said "],["932.94","oh no he's not thus verifying what I had "],["938.13","just communicated so side note the "],["941.43","reason the nurse yelled so adamant "],["943.9","was because at that time of my seizure "],["947.38","my face was literally pulled off my "],["950.26","skull I've got a big om scar here that "],["954.279","they had pulled down and my skull peeled "],["956.77","back as they were operating on my brain "],["959.97","whipping my head side to side at that "],["962.35","moment was I think the technical term is "],["964.93","bad not the right thing to do "],["970.86","immediately after the surgery the ER "],["973.99","trauma doctor a friend of the family "],["976.12","good thing he had to deliver the news to "],["979","my mom "],["980.55","doctors had to pull shattered fragments "],["982.839","of my skull out of my brain and they "],["986.38","realized that the damage was so bad that "],["988.57","they opted instead to simply remove half "],["990.88","of the frontal lobe of my brain that's "],["993.67","my emotional center I am now what is "],["995.89","called emotionally unstable that "],["1002.67","explains things great Oh also my optic "],["1006.779","nerve had been severed I would lose some "],["1009.36","sight in both eyes my right eye I'm "],["1011.22","almost entirely blind I lost my sense of "],["1014.31","smell because my nasal cavity was gone I "],["1018.24","had a direct route through my nose to my "],["1021.45","brain I literally could have taken a "],["1023.1","pencil and just poked my brain through "],["1024.87","my nose it was gone I actually had to "],["1029.37","learn how to sneeze without air going "],["1031.35","through my nasal cavity because I "],["1032.79","literally could have blown my brains out "],["1034.559","my nose good way to start a senior year "],["1040.05","I also became an epileptic over the "],["1043.35","course of that year I would shrink over "],["1045.51","an inch because my bones had spaced I "],["1048.03","was about to go through a growth spurt "],["1050","but I crushed my pituitary gland no more "],["1053.58","producing of the growth hormone based on "],["1056.7","how much I shrunk doctor said I probably "],["1058.59","should be about six six or six seven and "],["1061.41","to me that's like the worst part of all "],["1064.32","this it's like how big was I can't wait "],["1066.33","to go to heaven and get the body I "],["1067.65","should have had I don't be a monster "],["1070.67","I'll be looking down at Tom Weaver and "],["1073.5","be awesome "],["1074.34","anyway "],["1075.75","I had over 250 external stitches I had "],["1080.25","over 300 internal stitches that were "],["1082.5","holding my brain together that night my "],["1087.99","mom who seven hours earlier didn't "],["1091.049","recognize me when they wheeled me past "],["1093.03","her in the hallway said to dr.

which "],["1106.559","he replied "],["1107.4","I'll give him a 2% chance to survive til "],["1110.309","morning and then he started crying when "],["1114.24","the trauma doctor cries that's a bad "],["1118.14","sign I later discovered that while I was "],["1125.1","in surgery about 200 members of a church "],["1128.13","that I did not attend got together and "],["1132.27","prayed for me I had no idea how they "],["1136.799","knew I was in an accident I have no idea "],["1139.919","why they chose to pray for this kid that "],["1143.94","they didn't even know I don't know who "],["1145.59","they were to this day I don't know who "],["1147.419","they were long story short I woke up the "],["1152.01","next day complaining that they had cut "],["1153.809","my hair I was a little worried because I "],["1156.69","had brand new sneakers I thought I bled "],["1158.34","on them that would have been horrible I "],["1162.799","was out of the hospital in 11 days "],["1166.73","overtime the Epilepsy just went away it "],["1170.37","just stopped I had double vision for "],["1173.52","about six months they were gonna operate "],["1175.679","on that but it corrected itself I kind "],["1179.669","of have this big dent in my head it's "],["1181.38","actually a hole in the head some people "],["1182.82","are like I need that like a hole in my "],["1183.96","head so I got this dent because I have "],["1189.96","no skull there they cut the muscles from "],["1192","behind my ears and pack that in there so "],["1194.64","there's something taking up space and "],["1196.65","they were gonna fill it in with acrylic "],["1198.72","after the edges sort of calcified a "],["1200.549","little bit but they still didn't know "],["1202.89","how to fix the nasal cavity for those "],["1206.52","six months I could actually go and this "],["1208.049","would inflate and it was "],["1209.35","like old go in and out and you know it's "],["1215.77","fun at parties hey watch this "],["1220.049","fortunately though they didn't have to "],["1223.33","repair my nasal cavity when they x-rayed "],["1225.91","me to see how this dent was doing six "],["1229.84","months after the accident they noticed "],["1232.03","that my entire nasal cavity had grown "],["1235.419","back it just grew back that doesn't "],["1248.5","happen to put it

then on wait for it because I was "],["1297.34","filled with regret over my doubting that "],["1300.039","he existed and then third I would go on "],["1303.73","a search for God reading every religious "],["1307.03","philosophy that I could find except the "],["1311.26","Bible I lived a decade in fear of this "],["1316.36","God who had proven himself real I was "],["1318.58","trying to find the God who saved me by "],["1321.22","avoiding the very text that I was pretty "],["1323.74","sure it was the right one I read the "],["1326.11","Quran I read the Hindu Vedas "],["1328.179","I studied Taoism I studied Shintoism I "],["1330.7","studied Zoroastrianism I studied Greek "],["1333.039","and Roman and Viking and Mesoamerican "],["1336.13","mythology all while every single night

"],["1353.32","she wanted to raise our kids in a "],["1354.46","Christian home something happened I was "],["1359.649","sitting in church not really paying "],["1361.36","attention "],["1364.44","our pastor Pastor Clint which was my "],["1367.87","middle name but that doesn't tie into "],["1369.22","anything "],["1369.64","your name's pastor Clint no just claimed "],["1374.37","he was rambling on about I don't know "],["1378.909","something I couldn't follow him I was "],["1380.83","just flipping around in my Bible just "],["1382.779","reading random passages when when "],["1385.09","suddenly Clint said something that did "],["1388","kind of piqued my interest "],["1389.59","I looked up just as he was saying some "],["1392.38","of you have been beating yourself up for "],["1394.96","some past sin maybe for a decade God "],["1401.559","that caught my attention I wrecked in "],["1405.7","August of 1988 here it's August of 1998 "],["1409.47","hey that's a decade according to mama "],["1412.12","hath he said I want to tell you today "],["1415.929","that God forgives you did you hear me "],["1418.779","and then in a congregation of over 400 "],["1422.23","people so if this place was full "],["1425.97","congregation of 400 people Clint picked "],["1428.649","me out of the crowd looked me dead in "],["1430.51","the eyes and said God forgives you and "],["1435.779","then I remember nothing else of what he "],["1438.94","talked about in that sermon except that "],["1440.919","at the end of the sermon he resigned "],["1442.899","from the ministry I think he was picking "],["1449.019","people out of the crowd I don't think I "],["1451.87","was the only one who only heard a small "],["1453.909","part I think the Holy Spirit was using "],["1458.08","him to reach

"],["1470.26","as you see fit I offer you my all by the "],["1473.409","way that's a dangerous prayer because "],["1475.539","they'll do it "],["1476.68","try it fine I honestly at that point I "],["1488.46","haven't asked him to forgive me for that "],["1491.5","sin again oh and I can admit new one "],["1493.78","sure but that one's done and I now "],["1497.05","realize that and finally I actually "],["1500.41","began to read the Bible I started to "],["1502.3","read the Bible in a year plan and I'm "],["1504.37","proud to say it only took me four years "],["1505.84","to get through it

years that even now after "],["222","I've moved out and you know started my "],["224.1","own family on my own and they're 600 "],["225.96","plus miles away from home that I still "],["228.87","go to my dad for things you know I still "],["230.55","ask him for his help and advice and "],["232.53","share things with him that I'm going "],["234","through and struggling and it's just "],["235.53","such a blessing you know to have a "],["236.52","father like that who I can approach and "],["238.38","you know we have a Heavenly Father like "],["240.57","that we can pull the approach amen and "],["242.73","that's what this message is about but we "],["244.92","can't just come on our own yeah because "],["246.66","God is holy and we are such sinners but "],["251.01","praise be to God there is a way and "],["252.78","that's what we're gonna look at here "],["253.62","today and one of my favorite books in "],["255.45","the Bible the book of Hebrews and I'll "],["257.549","kind of get into that a little bit why I "],["258.96","just love this book so much and you'd "],["261.27","think that I'd probably preaching on "],["262.86","worship you know because it's one of my "],["263.94","passions and actually this message is "],["265.8","all about worship at the core in the "],["267.27","heart of it and you may not think so at "],["269.61","first but in due time I think you will "],["271.29","see as we dig into God's Word and see "],["272.97","the truth so this is all about worship "],["274.65","at the core of this message so boldly I "],["277.14","approach I picked that title because "],["278.76","well the offering song is you guys heard "],["280.65","that's the title that song and it fits "],["282.06","so well with what we're looking at here "],["284.729","in God's Word so I want you guys to turn "],["286.77","in your Bibles "],["287.849","phones scroll on your phones the Hebrews "],["289.889","10:19 through 25 and as you guys are "],["292.11","doing that I'm gonna give us a little "],["293.969","bit of background here on the book of "],["295.229","Hebrews because we've been in jeremiah "],["297.149","mode for the last three or so years "],["298.709","right "],["299.399","aiex remember the old days anybody else "],["300.839","remember the days before Jeremiah the "],["302.639","old ancient days right yeah good times "],["304.349","right now I love Jeremiah it's been it's "],["306.449","been great but since we've been kind of "],["308.58","focused on that I want to give you guys "],["309.569","a little bit of background on the book "],["311.009","of Hebrews so Hebrews is extremely "],["313.08","unique for a number of reasons first of "],["314.699","all we don't actually know who the "],["316.199","author of Hebrews was it's the only book "],["317.729","in the New Testament whose author we "],["319.11","can't clearly identify and that might "],["321.419","seem a little unsettling to you but to "],["323.009","me I find that actually really "],["324.36","encouraging because we know the ultimate "],["326.429","author of Scripture is God himself amen "],["328.499","and so we can always point back to him "],["330.479","it doesn't matter what guy wrote it we "],["332.069","don't know it doesn't really matter at "],["333.3","the end of the day but we know that God "],["335.129","is the author of Scripture it's his "],["336.149","words for us and that's the words we're "],["337.649","gonna look at here this morning secondly "],["339.509","the style of Hebrew is a little bit "],["341.789","different than the other you know New "],["343.08","Testament epistles you think of like "],["344.189","Paul's letters it does have like a "],["345.959","closing you know like an ending he says "],["347.459","you know greet so-and-so and blah blah "],["348.869","blah like you know he would typically "],["350.189","close a letter but doesn't have an "],["351.839","introduction and all throughout the book "],["353.759","it's kind of got this feel like like "],["355.439","rhetoric you know rhetoric like as if "],["357.269","like what I'm doing now right public "],["358.469","speaking and that's understood among "],["360.839","scholars that this book was actually a "],["362.49","compilation of oral messages or maybe "],["364.469","actually one oral message so I kind of "],["366.629","look at it as the sermonic letter it's "],["368.579","basically one big sermon in the letter "],["370.619","format isn't that so cool I just think "],["372.479","it's so cool so I'm gonna be doing a "],["373.409","sermon on a sermon that makes sense we "],["375.809","look in the book of Hebrews lastly I "],["377.519","want us to look at the audience so the "],["380.069","book of Hebrews as you might guess is "],["381.869","written to the Hebrews "],["383.55","so these of course are the Jews right "],["385.289","these are Jewish Christians and most "],["387.599","scholars believe that these were Jewish "],["389.369","Christians who were living in Rome and "],["390.719","you know if we know some of the the "],["392.429","background in history about the time of "],["394.05","Jesus right this is after his death and "],["395.789","resurrection and ascension to heaven "],["397.11","the Romans were ruling the world at that "],["398.999","time and so any Jewish Christians living "],["400.86","in Rome they were facing some increasing "],["403.589","pressures and persecution because of "],["405.509","their faith and this stuff is going to "],["407.069","come into play a lot more in our sermon "],["408.719","so you'll see why I've been giving you "],["409.979","guys all this background knowledge it's "],["411.089","not just to do a little you know "],["412.939","educational lecture so without further "],["416.189","ado let's dig into the Word of God and "],["417.719","see what he has to say to us "],["418.919","so Hebrews 10 starting in verse 19 "],["421.74","therefore brothers since we have "],["424.14","confidence to enter the holy places by "],["426.6","the blood of Jesus by the new and living "],["428.82","way that he opened for us through the "],["430.23","curtain that is through his flesh and "],["432.27","since we have a great priest over the "],["434.22","house of God let us draw near with a "],["437.13","true heart in full assurance of faith "],["439.41","with a heart sprinkled clean from an "],["441.96","evil conscience and our bodies washed "],["444.06","with pure water let us hold fast the "],["446.91","confession of our hope without wavering "],["448.67","for he who promised is faithful let us "],["452.1","consider how to stir up one another to "],["453.87","love and good works not neglecting to "],["456.66","meet together as is the habit of some "],["458.22","but encouraging one another and all the "],["460.71","more as you see the day drawing near so "],["466.05","this passage is pretty much a crucial "],["468.75","moment here in this sermon as I've been "],["470.46","saying the author of Hebrews he's been "],["472.68","building up to this point all throughout "],["474.63","the letter okay he's been trying to tell "],["476.82","this message again this was understood "],["478.35","to be like an oral message see he would "],["479.76","have shared it with the Jewish "],["480.99","Christians at that time and he's been "],["483.42","basically in a very eloquent way because "],["485.79","he's very good with his words as you can "],["487.17","see he's been explaining how Jesus is "],["489.99","better than everything it's better than "],["492.12","Moses he's better than the priests he's "],["494.1","better than the law he's better than the "],["495.09","angels he's better than anything else "],["496.47","Jesus is the greatest that's part of his "],["499.08","big argument and so we don't have time "],["500.67","to obviously dig through the last nine "],["502.14","and a half chapters here and look at all "],["503.97","the points he's been making because "],["505.53","thankfully the author gives us here a "],["507.18","brief summary in verses 19 through 21 "],["510.17","basically what he's been building up to "],["512.34","here and we're going to see the main "],["514.05","idea and then of three expectations that "],["516.3","come from it so what is the big idea "],["519.45","what is he talking about here you guys "],["521.52","will see quickly that I don't have the "],["523.77","same preaching styles pastor Rob and if "],["526.2","any of you were here a couple months ago "],["527.34","my dad preached I'd probably adopt a lot "],["528.93","of his preaching habits and you guys can "],["530.31","do a compare and contrast about how "],["531.96","similar we are people have called me doc "],["534.06","rock tune your mini rock or pebble "],["535.98","whatever you want to say "],["538.05","so I have a big idea there's always a "],["542.249","big idea that I want to hit home and so "],["544.319","if you guys don't remember anything else "],["546.209","I say today I want you guys to really "],["548.1","take this big idea with you okay that "],["550.709","we're gonna look at and see we can "],["552.66","boldly approach God because of Jesus "],["555.629","sacrificed to end all sacrifices all "],["557.699","right we can bold the approach God "],["559.139","because of Jesus sacrificed and all "],["561.029","sacrifices and that's seen here in the "],["562.949","first couple verses it says you know we "],["564.72","have confidence to enter these holy "],["566.1","places because of Jesus blood the way "],["567.989","that he opened up us opened up for us "],["570.329","through his flesh and his role as the "],["572.519","high priests so these verses are using a "],["575.069","lot of tabernacle and temple language "],["577.379","okay so we think of the tabernacle and "],["579.029","temple right we know from the Old "],["579.899","Testament and I think it would serve us "],["581.549","really well if we did a quick little "],["584.04","journey back in time we don't have to "],["585.689","turn Exodus but we're gonna look doable "],["587.67","review and over you overview of what the "],["589.739","tabernacle and temple worship look like "],["591.269","okay so I brought you guys a little "],["593.61","visual aid here I have it upside down so "],["599.009","here's the tabernacle this is from the "],["600.509","ESV Study Bible an image from it and I "],["602.369","know you don't have to worry about "],["603.209","reading the text that are so small "],["604.769","but you can see this general open space "],["607.41","which is actually smaller than a "],["608.699","football field it's not that big it's "],["610.589","like 75 feet 550 or something this is "],["613.35","where God dwelt with his people after "],["616.049","the people of Israel had been delivered "],["618.119","from Egypt right God led them out "],["619.529","through the Red Sea they were wandering "],["620.97","the wilderness for forty years and God "],["623.249","desired to dwell with his people and "],["624.749","they were living in tents right because "],["626.009","if you're trouble in the wilderness you "],["626.939","can't have a permanent dwelling space so "],["628.649","they're basically camping for 40 years "],["629.97","and so God says I want to camp with you "],["631.949","he wants to be in their presence so God "],["633.689","had Moses make him a tent as well so he "],["636.089","could dwell in the midst of his people "],["637.529","and it was actually in the midst because "],["638.999","the tabernacle was right smack dab in "],["641.279","the middle of the Israelites camping so "],["643.709","here in the tabernacle we're gonna walk "],["645.689","through just some of the different "],["646.679","elements because you're gonna see this "],["647.85","is all gonna help shed light and "],["649.559","illuminate better what author peepers "],["651.72","are saying cuz the book of Hebrews is "],["653.429","full of Old Testament stuff again he's "],["655.35","writing to who Jews right so juice would "],["658.11","have been saturated a wood grew up in "],["659.73","this stuff they know about the "],["660.509","tabernacle in the temple and the priests "],["661.919","and the sacrifices and feasts and "],["663.299","festivals and all that stuff right so we "],["665.429","don't always know that unless anybody "],["666.569","here is Jewish most of us are Gentiles "],["668.639","so we need a little bit of a refresher "],["669.99","on that so when you first come in the "],["671.49","tower "],["671.73","well the first thing you see is that "],["673.49","that bottom right there that large brown "],["676.589","thing that is the bronze altar the altar "],["678.36","of burnt-offering so it's the first "],["679.74","thing if you were a person of Israel "],["682.26","right put your shoes right now in the "],["683.459","shoes of an Israelite imagine your "],["684.42","newsreel light you come in to this "],["686.13","tabernacle and you're bringing with you "],["687.75","some sort of sacrifice you know it's "],["689.31","usually it's an animal like a sheep or a "],["690.75","goat and you bring this here and the "],["692.639","priests there are the representatives of "],["694.529","God so these are the guys you know who "],["695.79","are kind of working for God and they're "],["697.8","you they're out working on your behalf "],["699.72","they'll take your sheep your goat don't "],["702.329","give him a name I wouldn't recommend "],["703.35","that because don't get too attached cuz "],["705.389","they take him and then you know you know "],["709.05","how it goes so after that happens they "],["712.8","put him on the altar and they make a "],["714.12","sacrifice from it and the blood is "],["715.92","sprinkled on the four horns of the altar "],["717.66","you can't see it from here but there's "],["718.949","four little posts on the corners and "],["720.75","they sprinkle the blood all over that "],["722.01","and that's an important detail just to "],["724.019","keep in mind for the future alright so "],["725.88","after that you see it's kind of like a "],["727.889","little tub there that's the bronze basin "],["730.11","where they would wash the hand so the "],["731.399","priests would go here and they wash "],["733.17","their hands and it kind of makes sense "],["734.67","right they would need to because their "],["735.81","hands been all bloody touching lamb guts "],["737.699","or whatever so they need to wash off and "],["739.74","also it serves a ceremonial purpose "],["742.199","because they're about to enter into that "],["744.089","next building there in the top left "],["746.55","corner which is the tent of meeting and "],["748.17","to do that "],["749.1","they need to be clean right because "],["750.449","again God is holy and he demands purity "],["753.18","and we are sinners right stained by the "],["755.61","filth of our sin and so we can't "],["757.17","approach God just as we are so we have "],["759.06","to go through the priest and the "],["760.26","sacrifice the priests themselves as our "],["762.24","representative a have to be cleansed so "],["764.31","they go to this base and they wash up "],["765.6","all right so then they go in the next "],["767.61","room which is the tent of meeting so "],["769.769","here's a closer look at the tent of "],["770.97","meeting now this is where God's presence "],["773.22","is really dwelling and there's two rooms "],["776.19","you can see the first room there towards "],["777.6","the front that bigger room that is the "],["778.98","holy place the first room so the priest "],["780.93","can go in there okay if you're a priest "],["782.37","so you're from the tribe of Levi you can "],["783.81","go in there and there's the altar of "],["785.819","incense there's the golden lampstand on "],["787.529","the left closest to us like the menorah "],["789.089","right and the table of showbread so "],["791.31","they've got all these things in here I "],["792.93","want you to make note of that big "],["795.06","curtain at the back that you see that "],["796.889","curtain with the angels of cherubim on "],["799.11","them that is the veil and that veil has "],["801.86","extreme significance because it "],["804.209","separates the holy "],["805.74","place from the room behind it which is "],["807.15","the most holy place or the Holy of "],["809.01","Holies and the only person that can go "],["811.95","in that room back there is the high "],["813.93","priest and he can only go in there one "],["816.42","time a year so imagine that I was saying "],["819.06","to the first service II imagine if like "],["820.14","Pastor Rob's office was like I know "],["822.9","sounds really sacrilegious but the most "],["824.43","holy place and pastor Rob could only go "],["826.68","in his office one time of year like "],["827.88","that's kind of the concept if that makes "],["829.59","sense you know hopefully doesn't sound "],["831.24","like too sacrilegious so please don't "],["832.8","get there's nothing holy in Pastor Rob's "],["834.3","office so the most holy place is only "],["838.92","accessible by the high priest one time "],["840.78","of year on the day of atonement which is "],["842.73","the day when he goes and he sacrifices "],["844.56","for not only all the people of Israel "],["846.06","all the priests and also himself so "],["848.67","everybody has to be covered by the blood "],["851.25","and you're probably wondering why is "],["853.65","blood like why does everything have to "],["855.03","die you know like why can't you just "],["856.41","keep your lamb as a pet like why do you "],["857.97","have to you know kill everything "],["859.44","well blood have blood has a lot of "],["862.23","significance and I think pastor Rob "],["863.73","talked about at one communion but "],["864.78","there's a lot of significance in blood "],["866.1","itself and you know it's a sign of life "],["868.14","and Jesus or God requires blood it's his "],["872.31","requirement because of his holiness to "],["874.35","purify us in to cleanse for sin so the "],["875.97","only thing that can atone for anybody's "],["877.62","sins his blood there has to be a death "],["880.23","of someone or something and I might "],["882.18","start extreme but this is God right God "],["884.31","is holy and we are not we are so far "],["886.14","from him and his holiness and so we have "],["888","to come on his terms he's laid all this "],["889.95","down for us and so blood is significant "],["893.01","in this way like I said they sprinkled "],["894.24","the blood and their sprinkle the blood "],["895.5","on the mercy seat which is the top of "],["897.39","the Ark of the Covenant alright so "],["899.19","you're like well that was that was "],["900.33","really exciting Mike thanks for that "],["901.95","walk through time there in the "],["902.94","tabernacle all right again this is going "],["905.64","to come into play here in our passage "],["907.08","this has a lot of significance and it's "],["909.24","going to make a lot clearer the passage "],["911.25","that we're looking at here today all "],["912.6","right so the holy places now that he "],["916.86","says in verse 19 and we have comets to "],["918.57","enter that's referring to God's presence "],["920.37","right God dwelt there in the most holy "],["923.16","place it was actually the glory cloud is "],["924.78","what he dwelt and that was a signal "],["926.19","significant representation of God's "],["928.74","presence he dwell literally there in the "],["931.41","Holy of Holies again you see why only "],["933.6","the high priest could go once a year was "],["935.31","very very far off because we're such "],["938.16","sinners and he is "],["939.15","so holy well how do we get into God's "],["943.02","presence what does this passage say we "],["946.17","have confidence to enter the holy places "],["948.06","by the blood of Jesus by the new and "],["951.029","living way that he opened for us through "],["952.35","the curtain through his flesh and "],["954","because we have a great High Priest over "],["955.92","the house of God so Jesus's death on the "],["958.62","cross that was the death that ended all "],["962.16","sacrifices so now you don't have to go "],["964.65","and sacrifice your lamb or your goat or "],["966.779","whatever here with the priest in the "],["968.79","altar "],["969.27","Jesus sacrificed once and for all "],["972.41","sacrificed to end all sacrifices how "],["975.029","awesome is that and it says that the the "],["978.72","curtain was torn well the curtain is "],["980.4","another word for the veil right so that "],["982.11","veil we see there that was torn at Jesus "],["984.6","death and that is open the way and also "],["986.19","Jesus metaphorically his body was torn "],["988.83","right when he was killed on the cross "],["990.06","and you guys will probably remember in "],["991.83","the one of gospel accounts "],["994.8","it says the temple veil was torn right "],["996.75","in half from top to bottom at Jesus "],["999.089","death and that was extremely symbolic "],["1001.4","again because the people of Israel would "],["1003.17","know that the veil is what separates us "],["1005.54","from God's presence and when that bit "],["1007.07","was torn that clearly showed that we now "],["1009.08","have

"],["1096.96","gives us this author of Hebrews three "],["1098.79","exportations because of this and if "],["1101.1","you're wondering what what an "],["1101.91","exhortation is it's basically a very "],["1103.92","very strong encouragement you know like "],["1106.68","if somewhere to say I exhort you to do "],["1108.81","XY and Z like you probably should do it "],["1111.33","you know I mean it's almost like short "],["1113.55","of just saying like I command you to do "],["1115.38","this so an exhortation these are three "],["1117.66","expectations that he gives these are "],["1119.4","very strong encouragement and you were "],["1120.6","gonna see the phrasing is very clear he "],["1122.67","says let us dot dot which each with with "],["1125.1","each of these "],["1125.7","so our first

the most "],["1146.49","foundational and probably the most "],["1148.53","obvious one to you you know when you're "],["1150.54","looking at it but I think we still need "],["1152.19","to take a look at it closer alright so "],["1154.86","we know now we can approach God boldly "],["1157.26","because of Jesus sacrifice that ends all "],["1159.69","sacrifices and so the encouragement the "],["1162.33","exhortation "],["1162.96","is to draw near to God right the way has "],["1165.3","been opened so come to God he's opening "],["1167.52","the invitation to you this so this this "],["1169.95","verse here is I think in all ways a "],["1172.38","gospel invitation right he's saying here "],["1175.44","draw near to God with the true heart "],["1177.33","because God has opened up the way to him "],["1179.88","we have access now we should come to him "],["1182.31","right you guys probably saw the slide "],["1184.11","that actually was like the song based on "],["1185.79","it like come to the altar the father's "],["1186.99","arms are open wide and they're waiting "],["1189.9","for you to come in welcoming you with "],["1191.43","open arms but it's not just for for

in a relationship "],["1199.98","if we're not being intentional we can "],["1202.38","drift apart right it's always hard I've "],["1204.3","noticed this since moving far away from "],["1205.71","home too "],["1206.309","to maintain relationships from the past "],["1207.899","you know out of sight out of mind right "],["1209.519","as the saying goes and it's really hard "],["1210.869","you have to

"],["1219.599","our lifes with him and in gathering "],["1221.399","together with his people and feeding "],["1222.599","ourselves from his truth so you know "],["1224.129","we're gonna lose sight of

faith "],["1234.299","you know I think of insurance why "],["1236.009","insurance is great it protects you so "],["1237.479","you can have that that kind of "],["1238.679","confidence right if something bad were "],["1239.759","to happen but this is this is beyond "],["1241.769","that assurance is even stronger and it "],["1244.409","says full assurance so imagine it's like "],["1246.809","full capacity it's all the way you have "],["1249.539","nothing nothing to worry about nothing "],["1251.07","to fear it's been completely covered "],["1252.599","right Jesus death is completely atone "],["1255.359","for our sin his blood has paid the "],["1256.769","penalty in full praise God "],["1258.96","so we have 24/7 access to God's presence "],["1262.889","presence and that's such a privilege "],["1264.589","there's also two other parts of this two "],["1266.999","other descriptions and now you guys are "],["1268.83","gonna see little bit why I was giving "],["1270.179","you the walkthrough about the tabernacle "],["1271.259","right he says let us draw near with our "],["1273.719","hearts sprinkled clean from an evil "],["1276.359","conscience and our bodies washed with "],["1278.009","pure water so those are two little "],["1279.719","descriptions that again come from the "],["1281.609","tabernacle right remember I said the "],["1283.409","priest would that's I don't know how to "],["1286.139","act there go sprinkle with sprinkle the "],["1288.749","blood onto the altar so now our hearts "],["1290.729","have been sprinkled clean again the "],["1292.44","blood and the water the blood from the "],["1294.389","animal the water in the in the bronze "],["1296.129","basin those all served this purification "],["1298.2","and not literally right but it has a "],["1300.029","symbolic meaning that it would purify "],["1302.249","and cleanse us from our sins and our "],["1304.08","righteousness so that we can enter into "],["1305.549","God's presence so now our hearts have "],["1307.889","been sprinkled clean by the blood of the "],["1309.599","Lamb by Jesus and our bodies have been "],["1312.149","washed pure with the water and where do "],["1314.969","we think of most often being washed with "],["1316.979","water right what's uh what's that thing "],["1319.32","that there right we have baptism right "],["1321.57","this is the thing I mentioned the "],["1323.07","announcements this is a step of faith "],["1324.299","that we are called to take in God's Word "],["1326.519","that we do an active obedience and I "],["1328.859","always like to say this is my little "],["1330.21","cliche for it's an outward expression of "],["1333.45","an inward reality right an our "],["1335.19","expression of an inward reality when you "],["1337.259","go and get baptized you're not getting "],["1339.239","saved by the "],["1340.169","the baptism you should already be saved "],["1342.179","your professing to those who are in "],["1344.46","attendance they're the witnesses that "],["1346.019","you are afoul of Jesus saying I believe "],["1347.429","in Jesus and his death for me by faith "],["1349.289","and I want to tell the world about it "],["1351.269","and that's why people when they got "],["1352.499","saved think all throughout the book acts "],["1353.97","right away they got saved and they were "],["1355.649","baptized right that was all part of it "],["1357.809","so now you can kind of see where this "],["1359.97","Tabernacle language is coming in right "],["1361.919","sprinkling clean being washed with the "],["1364.169","water this is what happens to us when we "],["1366.45","approach God and so as a Christian we "],["1369.659","should never feel ashamed to draw near "],["1372.149","to God but often if you're like me you "],["1374.399","know I think things that would keep us "],["1375.779","from drawing close to God is our sin and "],["1377.909","shame right sometimes we feel you know "],["1379.889","we we've just sin too much or just our "],["1381.989","shame and guilt way down on us and we "],["1383.759","just feel like we can't come to God but "],["1386.22","that's not what the author here is "],["1387.179","saying right he's saying we can boldly "],["1389.58","approach him because if you are believe "],["1391.2","in Jesus Christ you've embraced his "],["1392.94","sacrifice for you that sacrifice that "],["1394.619","ends all other sacrifices and his blood "],["1397.019","has washed you clean and covered you "],["1398.7","completely and so no matter what you've "],["1400.379","done no matter what you're feeling or "],["1401.94","going through even doubts you may have "],["1403.619","you can come to Jesus boldly and draw "],["1406.44","near isn't it awesome I love this "],["1408.239","encouragement from it it's just so good "],["1409.71","and if you were like me growing up you "],["1412.619","probably play outside in the mud and the "],["1415.499","dirt right and you get all all filthy on "],["1417.929","your shoes and your pants or whatever "],["1419.46","and don't roll it wrong am I like crazy "],["1421.83","but you know take a mud bath well when "],["1424.139","my brother did that right we we go "],["1425.58","inside for dinner but momma say no need "],["1428.85","to wash off right need to clean off "],["1430.409","before you come in that house don't "],["1431.549","track that filthy stuff in here and "],["1433.35","we're not just gonna walk in there with "],["1434.399","our muddy boots and everything so we had "],["1436.559","to you know clean off before we could go "],["1438.269","inside and sometimes it was really "],["1439.169","tedious and I would just take my shoes "],["1441.029","off or whatever you know I mean just get "],["1442.2","rid of that dirty stuff so I can go "],["1443.909","inside and have dinner or whatever in "],["1445.409","the same way that's how we have to "],["1447.6","approach God right we have to be "],["1449.07","cleansed and washed clean before we can "],["1452.009","enter into his house into his presence "],["1454.289","to be in communion with him I love that "],["1456.299","picture "],["1456.629","and of course Jesus blood his death is "],["1459.09","the only thing that washes us completely "],["1460.679","all right so we saw that our first "],["1463.379","exhortation is to draw near to God in "],["1465.45","faith so let's look at our second one "],["1467.58","our second exhortation is in verse 23 "],["1470.029","let us hold fast the confession of our "],["1473.159","hope with "],["1473.67","wavering for he who promised is faithful "],["1475.82","well again thank you "],["1477.81","author of Hebrews made it really easy "],["1479.52","our second exhortation is we must hold "],["1481.47","fast our confession of hope and now "],["1484.29","first off the bat you guys might "],["1485.7","thinking likewise a confession of hope "],["1487.14","not confession of faith right normally I "],["1489.33","we usually hear this term confession of "],["1491.46","faith right what's your confession of "],["1492.75","faith well this is actually really true "],["1494.97","to the original Greek because the Greek "],["1496.65","word that's translated hope it means "],["1498.3","hope so faith is not as accurate and "],["1500.49","there's a difference between hope and "],["1501.81","faith you know and hope is not this kind "],["1503.82","of wishful thinking right you know like "],["1505.32","oh I hope it doesn't rain today or "],["1507.21","whatever right no this hope in the Bible "],["1510.06","it is grounded and rooted in Jesus and "],["1512.76","his promises it says right he is the "],["1515.34","faithful one he who promised is faithful "],["1518.52","so when you are hoping in something that "],["1521.1","is sure and never failing you can have "],["1524.13","confidence amen and that's the combin "],["1526.26","Swee have in jesus so we have this "],["1527.49","confession of hope in Jesus Christ and "],["1529.77","what he has done for us and now it says "],["1532.68","to hold fast it means like to keep "],["1534.03","secure right to cling on to it tightly "],["1535.71","to hold it don't let it go don't let go "],["1538.29","of that and there's a reason why he gave "],["1540.03","this exhortation to the Jewish "],["1541.53","Christians remember how I was saying in "],["1543.21","the background that they were facing "],["1544.89","pressures from the Romans right so the "],["1547.23","pressure that they were facing is that "],["1548.58","well Christianity was forbidden in the "],["1552.06","Roman Empire okay so it was basically a "],["1553.29","crime to be a follower of Jesus Christ "],["1554.82","but Judaism was actually tolerate and "],["1557.52","accepted so if you were a Jew you were "],["1559.32","off the hook but if you're Christian "],["1560.79","uh-huh "],["1561.42","you're in trouble so these Jewish "],["1562.89","Christians are a little bit conflicted "],["1563.94","you can imagine right they're fit facing "],["1565.86","this pressure and they're thinking you "],["1567.27","know maybe it's a good idea to go back "],["1568.68","to Judaism because at least I'll be safe "],["1571.17","right under Roman rule so that's part of "],["1573.84","the the problem that's going on here "],["1575.16","that the author of Hebrews is addressing "],["1576.69","he's saying no hold fast to your "],["1578.64","confession of faith cling to Jesus "],["1580.56","because he has carried you this far and "],["1582.72","he will carry you all the way because he "],["1584.28","who promised is faithful I meant so he "],["1587.01","takes us all the way and he carries us I "],["1589.59","like to think of this for us today as "],["1592.17","well you know what because we are not "],["1594.93","facing Roman rule or oppression like "],["1596.58","that but the things of this world the "],["1598.5","pressures in way of this world if we're "],["1599.85","not clinging to Jesus they will break us "],["1601.74","down and you guys can probably testify "],["1603.6","that right so if we're not holding fast "],["1606.36","to our "],["1606.88","confession of hope in Jesus Christ it's "],["1609.31","gonna break us down and eat us up alive "],["1611.77","and that's why we have to hold fast to "],["1614.5","Jesus Christ so you guys are probably "],["1618.52","are aware of this by now but me and "],["1620.62","rollercoasters don't get along very well "],["1622.06","and you know the first time I went on a "],["1625","roller coaster with Amy wasn't my first "],["1626.8","ever ride but you know the first time I "],["1628.48","went on a rollercoaster was at Busch "],["1629.62","Gardens with her I think was Apollo's "],["1632.11","Chariot you know she she took me on it "],["1633.88","and I was so dumb I don't know why at "],["1636.01","some point I said like any time we go to "],["1637.66","a theme park I have to ride one ride "],["1639.13","with her now I don't know how I how I "],["1641.32","talked myself into that but now I'm "],["1643.54","stuck anyways you know when you're on a "],["1646.24","roller coaster right you get in the ride "],["1647.74","and before they take off they go you "],["1650.02","know the safety protocol stuff and you "],["1651.55","know there's usually a handle bar or "],["1652.6","some sort of mechanism right that will "],["1654.07","secure you're in your seat and you'd "],["1655.87","want to like hold on to right for "],["1657.52","security well I take that really "],["1659.53","literally again because I don't like "],["1660.7","roller coasters so where's that "],["1661.99","handlebar in front of you I'm like you "],["1664.57","know death grip on it white knuckles "],["1666.78","holding on for dear life even before "],["1668.98","we're taking off I'm just you know I'm "],["1670.72","bracing for whatever's going to happen "],["1671.83","and so when that roller coaster goes out "],["1673.87","and the ups and downs and the loop set "],["1675.73","it's going through I'm just clinging on "],["1677.38","to that thing and Amy looks over you "],["1679.21","know I'm pretty much just like this the "],["1680.56","whole time just like and my happy places "],["1683.14","I like to call her I'm just blocking out "],["1685","everything around me my only thought is "],["1686.74","like is it over is it over is it over "],["1688.42","that's all that's going on but that's "],["1691","the idea here that the author of Hebrews "],["1692.38","is trying to communicate when we hold "],["1693.91","fast to our confession we are clinging "],["1695.68","for dear life because Jesus is our only "],["1698.14","hope our only anchor I love that passage "],["1699.37","that share Sarah shared here and during "],["1702.76","the worship set because we have this "],["1705.25","anchor and a hope because of Jesus and "],["1707.68","said he's the one that I want you to "],["1709.21","think of that way you know like I hold "],["1710.8","on the handlebars hold on to Jesus for "],["1712.45","dear life hold on to your confession of "],["1714.19","faith in him because he will carry you "],["1715.99","through the ups and downs the "],["1717.4","rollercoaster of life right we all know "],["1718.75","life can be a roller coaster we don't "],["1720.28","know what's going to happen here even in "],["1722.11","this country for us as believers but we "],["1723.58","cling to Jesus and we are safe in him "],["1726.1","amen so the last exhortation that he "],["1729.4","gives his here in verses 24 to 25 he "],["1733.12","says but consider how to stir up one "],["1736.39","another to love and good works not "],["1738.67","neglecting to meet together as is the "],["1740.11","habit of "],["1740.59","some but encouraging one another and all "],["1743.08","the more as you see the day drawing near "],["1745.169","alright so again he does it makes it "],["1747.789","easy for me we must encourage one "],["1749.14","another as we meet together so really "],["1751.84","quick let's talk to the progression of "],["1753.82","these expectations right the first one "],["1755.23","to draw near to God that's about our "],["1757.179","initial relationship with God right "],["1760.12","coming before him entering into his "],["1762.1","presence like I said the veil is gone "],["1763.809","Jesus has opened up away now for us to "],["1765.73","come before the Father so we draw near "],["1767.59","to him then we hold fast right hold fast "],["1770.71","our confession in Jesus and now we take "],["1772.84","it to the next level and this is our "],["1774.19","relationship with others specifically "],["1776.32","other believers right and we're called "],["1778.33","to encourage one another so the word "],["1780.549","here stir up in some translations maybe "],["1783.46","you have this it's actually translated "],["1784.87","provoke which usually when we hear the "],["1787.029","word provoke we think you know negative "],["1788.5","connotation right like don't provoke "],["1790.21","your brother or don't provoke your "],["1791.35","sister right that kind of thing but that "],["1793.419","is actually I think maybe a more "],["1794.98","accurate way that he's using this this "],["1796.539","word here to provoke one another to love "],["1799","and good works so provoking it's like "],["1800.919","this strongly urging you know look let's "],["1802.75","do this let's show the love of Christ in "],["1805.029","our lives "],["1805.6","let's serve one another through the good "],["1807.25","works because of what Jesus has done for "],["1808.929","us and his love for us it should provoke "],["1810.909","us to provoke one another to serve God "],["1813.94","and to love him in that's the calling "],["1816.039","here and this is what Jesus had already "],["1818.14","had in mind for the church this is what "],["1820.059","it's really supposed to look like this "],["1821.62","is what the New Covenant worship right "],["1823.33","we looked at the Old Covenant the "],["1824.5","tabernacle this is what the new system "],["1826.39","worship looks like we are under the "],["1828.58","blood of Jesus covered washed clean and "],["1830.799","now we are called to provoke one another "],["1833.23","to love and to good works and then he "],["1835.929","makes this interesting side comment here "],["1839.23","he says not neglecting to meet together "],["1842.23","as is the habit of some like what's all "],["1845.44","that about why would you say that sounds "],["1846.669","like one of those like you know side "],["1848.169","jabs oh you know some of you haven't "],["1850.36","been meeting together so clearly there "],["1852.88","was a reason that he mentioned this "],["1853.929","again if we look at the context here "],["1856.27","these Jewish Christians they were being "],["1857.559","persecuted by the Roman Empire "],["1858.88","remembered Judaism is okay Christianity "],["1861.909","is not and so they're facing this "],["1863.74","pressure to go back to Judaism and the "],["1866.98","Christians at this time again they were "],["1868.299","meeting in homes right they didn't have "],["1869.409","nice buildings like this they were "],["1870.789","meeting in house churches and I can "],["1872.649","imagine the Jewish Christians and "],["1874.48","they would gather in the house churches "],["1875.92","in there would be probably a temptation "],["1877.84","to not go right to their local gathering "],["1880.3","you know I could see a Jewish family "],["1881.77","being Jewish Christian family being like "],["1883.33","yeah you know what honey "],["1884.74","um think well we'll stay home today play "],["1887.29","it safe there's a lot of Roman Roman "],["1889.09","guards out there and as a cincher and I "],["1891.1","just saw on the other block or whatever "],["1892.3","I think we need to stay safe well just "],["1894.1","let's just stay at home you know in "],["1895.36","worship worship here I think that was a "],["1897.52","very real temptation in situation for "],["1899.77","many of these Jewish Christian believers "],["1901.42","they would have been targeted you know "],["1905.02","if they were going to these house "],["1905.95","searches the Romans probably were "],["1907.15","watching these things and you have a "],["1909.16","target on your back you know when you "],["1910.15","attend one these home churches we know "],["1911.83","right with with brothers and sisters "],["1913.42","around the world they face a lot of "],["1915.34","persecution for their faith to go and to "],["1917.59","meet together you know they can risk "],["1918.7","their life so you hear about the "],["1919.6","underground Church in China why is it "],["1921.76","underground right because they need to "],["1924.04","do it without being noticed "],["1925.66","so there is that very real reality and "],["1927.52","pressure and that's what is prompting "],["1929.65","the author of Hebrews to address it see "],["1931.03","some of you are not meeting together and "],["1932.44","so he's saying even if there is that "],["1934.36","pressure right we hold fast to Jesus "],["1935.98","like we've been talking about and we can "],["1937.39","still meet together we should not "],["1938.68","neglect it for any reason like that so "],["1941.08","even if that were to happen here in the "],["1942.55","states you know I pray that all of us "],["1943.81","would still feel the desire right and "],["1947.14","the need to meet together and maybe we "],["1948.88","would have an underground Church in the "],["1949.99","u.s. who knows right a USA underground "],["1953.2","Saints of America there you go so the "],["1958.36","same yeah the same as for us here today "],["1959.98","and the question is why why do we need "],["1963.19","to meet together why is it so important "],["1964.75","he gives I think two reasons here the "],["1966.55","first one I think is pretty natural "],["1968.11","right we need to encourage one another "],["1970.12","to love and good works it's kind of hard "],["1972.22","to encourage one another if we're not "],["1973.69","meeting together once you agree now of "],["1976.12","course we live in the day and age where "],["1977.35","you can concur Amin's does have to be "],["1979.81","face to face but again we're talking "],["1981.52","about the word right provoke I should "],["1983.23","say right not incurred let's provoke one "],["1985","another film good works it's a lot "],["1986.44","easier to provoke someone face to face "],["1988.27","then through you know an email although "],["1991.33","people can use all caps and stuff like "],["1992.8","that so we won't get into that but we "],["1995.71","are called to do this so we need to meet "],["1997.48","together so we can encourage one another "],["1998.59","but there's a second reason he gives "],["2000.6","nets urgency there is an urgency for us "],["2003.93","to meet together as Christians because "],["2005.31","he says as the day "],["2007.92","as you see the day drawing near all the "],["2009.54","more as you see the day drawing near and "],["2010.92","what is this day that he's talking about "],["2012.3","so I think the Greek will actually help "],["2015.21","us out here and I'm not going to dig "],["2016.41","into Arabic some expert but I'm gonna "],["2019.29","probably this pronunciation the Greek "],["2021.27","word that is translated meet together is "],["2023.34","epi synagogue a epi soon ago gay so that "],["2026.67","is translated to me meet together that "],["2028.77","occurs only two times in New Testament "],["2030.99","that word is only here two times right "],["2033.09","here on this verse verse 25 or verse 24 "],["2035.82","and also in 2nd Thessalonians 2:1 which "],["2038.58","talks about the coming of our Lord Jesus "],["2040.14","and our being gathered together to him "],["2043.53","those the only two times we see this "],["2045.84","Greek word in the New Testament and I "],["2047.61","think there's a connection between these "],["2049.08","two right so to think about it as we're "],["2051.33","gathering together as believers we're "],["2053.429","looking for we were looking forward to "],["2054.96","that day when we will ultimately be "],["2056.94","gathered together to our Lord Jesus "],["2058.71","Christ in heaven amen and that is the "],["2061.169","day he's talking about here this day is "],["2062.399","his return his second coming says the "],["2064.38","date which we all know is drawing near "],["2066.12","each and every day is one day closer to "],["2067.77","Jesus return I can least say that "],["2069.149","confidently because no one knows the day "],["2070.77","or the hour I don't know when he's "],["2071.7","coming back but I know that today is "],["2072.96","closer than yesterday that's all I can "],["2074.46","tell you "],["2075.03","so this is our urgent our urgency that "],["2077.58","we should meet together we should "],["2078.87","provoke one another to love and good "],["2080.55","works and when I was in eighth grade "],["2085.49","every eighth grade class would would do "],["2088.11","a play right so our play my eighth grade "],["2091.169","year was the line which in the wardrobe "],["2092.82","and I was mr. Tumnus which was great "],["2095.13","that was the peak of my my acting career "],["2096.84","by the way and I wish I had had the "],["2099.12","facial hair because they had to like put "],["2100.98","like glue like little fake you know hair "],["2103.11","on my beard F if they wait a couple "],["2104.61","years I probably wouldn't probably would "],["2105.99","have needed that but I've just had the "],["2107.46","natural stuff going but I wasn't I was "],["2109.86","in the the play of languish in the "],["2111.24","wardrobe and this was eighth grade like "],["2112.59","I said and I have to stay after school "],["2114.36","most days because of my mom's job and "],["2116.01","stuff so I would go to the rehearsals "],["2118.41","even if I didn't have to be there right "],["2119.64","because you know mr. Thomas is not like "],["2121.11","the main character he's not in every "],["2123.15","scene although maybe I wanted him to be "],["2124.98","like Oh mr. tell us this here what do "],["2126.48","that you know i partitioned to make sure "],["2129.03","I could use my umbrella to fight which "],["2130.56","was really cool and I didn't realize "],["2132.09","that he used that in the movie so that "],["2133.02","was really fun we got wooden swords "],["2134.52","anyways so they have rehearsals you know "],["2137.19","every day after school and I would just "],["2138.66","go to the rehearsals cuz you know I had "],["2139.98","nothing better to do I'm waiting after "],["2141.03","school "],["2141.65","so I'd go there and I'd stand in for "],["2143.21","somebody else you know could be Peter "],["2144.89","admin I think it did as well and maybe "],["2146.63","once or twice and mr. beaver you know "],["2148.309","stand in for those roles and it was just "],["2149.9","really fun to kind of go through all "],["2151.069","that but I would see you know as being "],["2152.749","part of that experience that like you "],["2154.789","have to have rehearsals right and I "],["2156.41","don't know for the whole thing to come "],["2157.4","together we're looking forward to this "],["2158.48","performance that's coming up in a couple "],["2159.92","months well we've got to do the "],["2161.509","rehearsals we got to meet together and "],["2163.19","go through our roles go through the "],["2164.99","lines practice the scenes you know start "],["2166.91","using props and you have a dress "],["2167.99","rehearsal and writing it builds up "],["2169.309","bigger and bigger until the final "],["2170.359","performance I think that's the same "],["2172.039","thing here that that the author is "],["2173.839","talking about right when we meet "],["2175.16","together we're preparing for that great "],["2177.38","day when we are in Jesus presence you "],["2179.15","know so I don't want to necessarily say "],["2180.71","like this is a rehearsal Church you know "],["2182.9","what I mean like this is real Church but "],["2184.579","in a way this is not the ultimate thing "],["2185.99","right we're preparing for something much "],["2187.549","greater so when we gather together here "],["2189.47","we all have different roles to write we "],["2191.839","all have different parts in the body "],["2193.099","that God has gifted us to serve and "],["2195.17","bring for the edification of all so we "],["2197.21","come together and we serve and we "],["2199.069","encourage or provoke one another to love "],["2200.66","and good works as we're preparing for "],["2202.009","that great day when we are with Jesus "],["2204.349","forever I love it so we must encourage "],["2207.17","one another as we meet together all "],["2209.869","right I'm gonna wrap it up here I'm "],["2211.7","probably already going long so what is "],["2214.309","our big idea I hope you guys all have it "],["2216.41","by now right "],["2217.599","what is our big idea we can bold the "],["2221.599","approach God because of Jesus sacrifice "],["2223.94","to end all sacrifices that is the hope "],["2226.999","we have and we saw the three x rotations "],["2228.859","so I just want to walk through those "],["2231.109","excitations again for all of you guys "],["2232.579","the first one we had right was to draw "],["2234.349","near to God in faith we must draw near "],["2236.66","in faith and if you're here today and "],["2239.66","you've never made that decision to do "],["2242.69","for the first time you know I encourage "],["2244.97","you to come to the Lord and confess your "],["2248.539","sins to him and you may say you know my "],["2250.309","sins are too great or too many you know "],["2252.019","that nothing could cover that you know "],["2253.43","I'd be sacrificing my whole life "],["2255.049","well under the old worship the Old "],["2257.39","Covenant we would but praise be to God "],["2259.73","that there is a new covenant man and "],["2261.289","Jesus has paid it all so it doesn't "],["2263.359","matter humph how many sins you've done "],["2265.339","or how bad you may think they are he's "],["2267.68","covered it all he's paid the penalty so "],["2269.749","I want you to be encouraged here that "],["2271.7","you can come to God just as you are and "],["2274.249","all "],["2275.03","for yourself completed him say I "],["2276.38","surrender myself to you may your blood "],["2278.99","wash over me and cleanse me anew with "],["2281.3","your righteousness and for those of you "],["2284.42","who are here and you have made the "],["2285.83","decision right you've drawn near to God "],["2287.15","you've made that initial approach to him "],["2289.25","again like I said it's a relationship "],["2291.23","and we we can drift apart so my "],["2293.72","encouragement is for you to renew that "],["2296.08","relationship with the Lord to come close "],["2298.91","to him to feel that confidence that no "],["2300.65","matter what you've done "],["2301.58","don't let your sin or your shame where "],["2303.29","you don't even if you feel you know "],["2304.79","there's something you've done or "],["2305.63","something going on that you can't talk "],["2306.74","to any person about the first person you "],["2308.69","should always run to is God now I try to "],["2310.73","make that my habit anytime like you know "],["2312.14","I'm convicted of sin or something "],["2313.46","happens like I go to God first and I "],["2315.08","just want to make things right with him "],["2316.79","you know because he is my Savior my "],["2317.93","Creator and then I will go and reconcile "],["2319.97","what the person I may have wronged so "],["2322.37","that is that is the call for us that we "],["2324.05","draw near to him he is the way and the "],["2327.11","truth and the life no one comes except "],["2328.97","through him and then we have to cling to "],["2331.85","our hope in him right hold fast "],["2333.68","hold fast to our confession of Hope well "],["2336.94","how's that going are you holding fast or "],["2340.13","the way that there is the weight of the "],["2341.6","world breaking you of that are you "],["2343.31","losing your grip you know I don't I "],["2345.08","don't always maintain a death grip I "],["2346.55","wish I would hold on to Jesus as tightly "],["2348.29","as I have on to the roller-coaster "],["2349.46","handlebars I wish I think we all could "],["2351.83","agree with that right the things of this "],["2353.48","world they will they will shake us and "],["2355.34","try to break us apart from that that "],["2357.53","closeness to him but I want you guys to "],["2360.13","start instilling this kind of response "],["2363.95","that as the world pushes harder on you "],["2367.06","you cling harder to Jesus you hold "],["2369.89","tighter to him the harder it pushes "],["2371.54","against you the tighter you hold to him "],["2373.64","amen that's what we want to do we want "],["2375.65","to cling to him ask him to give you that "],["2377.57","confidence so that we can boldly come to "],["2379.19","him and hold fast to his assurance "],["2381.05","because again we don't know where our "],["2382.37","country's going pastor Rob talks about "],["2383.84","this right we don't we don't know what's "],["2385.22","going to be happening here but we need "],["2386.78","to hold fast to Jesus and then lastly we "],["2389.63","talked about provoking one another right "],["2391.31","to love and good work no don't just "],["2393.35","don't just say oh yeah Mike said we go "],["2394.82","provoke one another and then start like "],["2396.38","stirring up fights or whatever provoke "],["2398.33","each other to love and good works right "],["2400.37","that's what that's what we're supposed "],["2401.87","to be about here and this this could be "],["2404.48","tough I really could be to be honest "],["2406.25","with you like I sometimes have to do "],["2407.42","this myself but "],["2408.68","I think the only way that this is going "],["2409.97","to be beneficial for us is if we're "],["2411.529","truly honest with ourselves and with God "],["2413.42","so I want you to take time and really "],["2417.23","ask the Loden you know why do I come to "],["2418.67","church why do I come here again I said "],["2420.65","this will only be beneficial if you're "],["2421.94","truly honest I think I'd be really "],["2423.829","rewarding experience and endeavor to go "],["2425.69","through like is it because you've always "],["2427.309","had you always have you grew up doing it "],["2429.619","you know it's just what you're supposed "],["2431.15","to do right it's a good thing to do like "],["2432.5","really dig down do some soul-searching "],["2435.17","and ask God why why is it that I come "],["2437.599","here because I think we knew this we "],["2439.549","need this reminder right to not neglect "],["2441.44","meeting together as is the habit of some "],["2443.15","because we probably could all see right "],["2444.47","we we we look around we could see there "],["2447.079","are some that we know that you know "],["2448.369","aren't always mean together and why is "],["2449.99","that you know think about why we don't "],["2452.48","and then ask the Lord to give you this "],["2454.43","desire this fervent passion to be with "],["2456.77","his people you know to be in community "],["2458.089","to be like here and the presence of the "],["2459.859","Lord with other believers where we can "],["2461.27","worship and celebrate together and not "],["2463.549","just here as you guys saw there's a lot "],["2465.109","of small groups going on that's a great "],["2466.94","way to get connected with other "],["2468.26","believers and to plug in and then got "],["2471.2","the part that's on ours are ourselves "],["2472.91","right the responsibility to provoke one "],["2474.71","another so how can we be doing it it "],["2477.079","says consider he says let us consider "],["2479.599","how to stir up one another provoke one "],["2481.16","another so this requires some thought "],["2482.48","and preparation we need to be thinking "],["2484.609","and like being intentional what are ways "],["2486.38","that I can help promote love and service "],["2488.75","amongst my fellow believers you know "],["2490.4","maybe maybe you're serving in a ministry "],["2492.41","like one or something and you ask a "],["2494.299","friend or somebody hey why don't you "],["2495.559","come join me to help serve out and "],["2496.819","wonder because one is starting up here "],["2497.9","right or maybe you have someone in a "],["2499.43","Bible study or small group that you're "],["2500.75","part of and you know maybe they've been "],["2502.01","having struggles in their faith and you "],["2503.66","can go talk to them and encourage them "],["2505.279","in their faith to step out and serve "],["2508.21","there's a lot of different ways again "],["2510.14","I'm not gonna give you that as an "],["2511.039","example you talk to the Lord and ask him "],["2512.99","for these things and I think that's what "],["2514.67","we should all do right now that's the "],["2515.869","appropriate response so let's come "],["2517.01","before the Lord and ask him to open our "],["2519.349","hearts and our eyes to what we can do to "],["2521.089","serve him better as we boldly come "],["2522.829","before Jesus "],["2524.44","Heavenly Father lo we just we thank you "],["2527.27","so much Jesus for making away this new "],["2530.21","and living way Lord that you've opened "],["2531.799","us up opened up for us Lord to come "],["2534.17","before you lord into your presence we "],["2536.779","can boldly approach you Jesus now "],["2538.88","there's nothing that holds us back Lord "],["2541.49","we do "],["2542.36","received by faith or your gift of "],["2544.34","eternal life and the grace that you've "],["2545.81","poured out on us Jesus and I can pray "],["2547.49","for that anybody here who has not yet "],["2549.41","made a decision Lord to draw near to "],["2551.3","Lord that you would draw them to "],["2552.83","yourself and they would see Lord that no "],["2555.35","sin no shame is too great "],["2558.26","for your for your blood to cover you "],["2560.3","atone completely Lord Jesus and we thank "],["2562.19","you for that for that promise we have in "],["2564.05","you the Lord will you help us to cling "],["2567.98","to you to hold fast Lord for dear life "],["2570.41","to the confession that we have in you "],["2572.72","Jesus the hope that you've given us "],["2574.64","because you are so faithful we know that "],["2576.41","your promises never fail and they never "],["2577.91","will Lord give us the courage to stand "],["2581.24","by you no matter what happens in this "],["2584.6","life or no matter where we go on the "],["2586.01","rollercoaster that is our life so just "],["2587.81","maybe we cling to you for dear life lord "],["2590.42","I

is the "],["110.209","Philippines in the world and why is this "],["111.95","important because you're like aha we "],["113.509","know geography about ten years ago I was "],["116.959","working in a company and I was talking "],["120.14","to my wife on the phone we were working "],["121.91","in Alabama and I was practicing my "],["124.25","Tagalog with her filipino language and a "],["128.17","co-worker happened over here me talking "],["131.27","to her on the phone and after I get off "],["133.28","the phone she stops and she says what "],["136.58","language are you speaking sometimes "],["138.44","speaking Filipino or Tagalog it's the "],["140.3","language of the Philippines and she "],["142.22","looked at me with a straight face she "],["144.019","says oh are you Filipino and I'm "],["148.16","thinking like I'm a lily-white American "],["151.61","boy and she looks at me with a straight "],["153.53","you know "],["154.099","there's a first and last time that "],["156.17","somebody's asked me if I'm Filipino "],["158.12","and I'm thinking you know what maybe she "],["159.59","doesn't know where the Philippines is "],["160.939","maybe she thinks it's in Europe so so I "],["163.579","tell people the Philippines is in "],["165.829","Southeast Asia it's a something the "],["169.549","neighbors as China to the northwest "],["171.549","Indonesia to the South and Japan to the "],["174.739","far north so just it's about ten "],["178.25","thousand miles from here so kind of far "],["180.409","away from here "],["181.939","what is our ministry we're in the "],["183.889","northern part of the Philippines and "],["185.749","Luzon it's about four or five hours "],["188.48","north of Manila about Oh 120 miles north "],["192.23","of Manila our mission theme is to train "],["194.81","and to teach the Word of God to Filipino "],["196.79","people in particular our emphasis is to "],["198.919","train and teach local pastors who can "],["202.099","train and teach others in their "],["203.81","congregations and as a believer it's not "],["206.989","just getting saved that's so important "],["208.819","that's the initial step to coming to "],["211.489","know the Lord is to believe and to trust "],["213.889","in him as our Savior to believe in the "],["216.139","gospel but what is after that "],["218.829","discipleship growth how important in "],["222.079","your life in all of our lives for "],["224.329","believers is to grow in grace and "],["226.37","knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus "],["228.049","Christ we know that's important so our "],["231.47","main ministry is to train and teach "],["233.689","pastors so everything stems from that so "],["238.28","we have here in 2nd Timothy 2:2 this is "],["241.4","Paul speaking the Timothy says in the "],["243.109","things which you have heard from me "],["244.819","and the presence of many witnesses these "],["247.31","entrust to faithful men who would be "],["250.159","able to teach others as well and if you "],["253.129","notice the flow chart in that verse "],["254.78","there are four generations mention that "],["257.15","verse we have Paul is speaking the words "],["260.75","to Timothy what is Timothy to do he's to "],["264.919","what to teach faithful men and what are "],["268.25","the faithful men to do the fourth "],["269.84","generation is to teach that the third "],["274.58","generation the faithful men are to teach "],["276.11","others as well so we have four "],["277.729","generations of people in that verse and "],["279.979","in Asia even now we are the product as "],["282.889","Christians of that ministry that's been "],["285.11","going on since the beginning of the "],["286.88","church "],["287.3","over 2,000 years so our main ministry is "],["292.37","we have a seminary in our house and a "],["294.44","Bible Training Center to Train pastors "],["297.35","so our ministry is one of discipleship "],["299.81","because when you train somebody or in "],["303.44","what we do personal discipleship as well "],["305.42","but when you train an individual or uu "],["307.61","disciple somebody that's kind of like "],["309.35","training by addition which is good but "],["312.32","isn't it better to use multiplication so "],["314.66","when you go into a country me being a "],["316.67","foreigner "],["317.24","although one wife is Filipino it's "],["320.3","somewhat we believe it's more effective "],["321.83","not just to train one person but to "],["324.62","train a pastor or an elder and what are "],["327.65","they to do when you train that pastor "],["329.63","elder they can train and teach a whole "],["332.21","congregation and what I believe led me "],["336.14","to the Philippines is in America we are "],["339.83","blessed with many great Bible teaching "],["341.9","churches and I believe I'm so thankful "],["343.4","that I was a part of one in Alabama but "],["345.89","can you imagine if you're a pastor and "],["348.37","you don't really know how to interpret "],["350.51","the Scriptures and isn't that sad "],["352.67","doesn't that for me as a Christian that "],["355.91","broke my heart especially I'm like wow "],["357.56","that's so sad that many pastors in the "],["360.14","Philippines that there's not an emphasis "],["362.12","on correct "],["363.56","biblical interpretation and God he holds "],["366.92","specialty pastors James 3:1 what do we "],["369.44","know that verse it's scary isn't it "],["370.97","pastor Rob about that we are accountable "],["373.34","to God that we incur a stricter judgment "],["376.28","before the Lord "],["377.48","once we stand in this pulpit that we are "],["380.93","held accountable for what we teach and "],["382.7","what we preach "],["384.23","so it's very important if you're a "],["387.32","pastor to to accurately proclaim the "],["390.83","Word of God so I believe that that's why "],["394.01","the Lord brought me to the Philippines "],["396.35","is to treat train and teach pastors and "],["399.08","that's what we're doing in our home we "],["401.42","have had two different graduating "],["404.33","classes already we have a seminary in "],["406.64","our home pretty much our first floor is "],["408.89","our training center where we have a "],["411.02","classroom we have a library where they "],["414.74","can read different theological books and "],["417.23","we also have another training center "],["421.05","in the mountain province as well we'll "],["423.27","talk about our other two classes so we "],["425.099","teach basically Bible interpretation is "],["427.56","called hermeneutics we teach biblical "],["429.84","Greek we teach a theology practical "],["433.86","theology systematic theology and we "],["436.259","emphasize verse by verse study of the "],["438.21","word of God so it's it's a lot of fun "],["440.52","and training pastors and we have a lot "],["443.039","of guys and pastors and church planters "],["445.409","in our ministry but we have some ladies "],["446.879","as well so we're it's open to anybody "],["448.71","who wants to attend and to learn the "],["450.75","Bible also in our seminary pastoral "],["455.099","training we have we have one in our home "],["458.58","in bug you and two what I call province "],["461.909","or village classes and one is in a "],["464.669","mountain province and the other we had "],["466.65","in Nueva Vizcaya and both of these are "],["469.409","kind of in a remote mountainous places "],["472.13","kind of off the beaten path so I feel "],["475.62","like I has a lowered expanded our "],["477.84","ministry it wasn't just in the city but "],["479.639","to take the the message of the Word of "],["481.77","God and to train pastors in the villages "],["484.139","as well and the mouth especially in the "],["485.37","mountain villages so we're very thankful "],["487.139","for our classes as well so here's some "],["492.12","pictures apologize it's kind of hard to "],["494.52","see but we have different classes "],["497.779","different pastors and that

for free by the way actually "],["513.69","we don't charge we don't charge a "],["515.61","tuition fee so the pastors they just "],["518.099","they come some of them I have one one of "],["522.149","our pastors in our house he most of them "],["525.27","are local but he comes he drives a "],["527.04","motorcycle two and half hours every time "],["529.41","to come to class so he's

the outside of the church so "],["1463.929","thankfully the church was small it's not "],["1465.609","as big as this church but they could do "],["1467.83","it in all of one day everybody working

they they really "],["1482.859","enjoyed him being there so another thing "],["1486.22","what's amazing in the Philippines is the "],["1488.32","openness to the gospel so maybe in the "],["1492.49","time of the mission-team stay in the "],["1494.649","Philippines we probably they probably "],["1497.259","spoke at like different schools many "],["1499.6","public schools and the Philippines "],["1501.24","elementary schools and some even high "],["1503.32","schools as well and some private and "],["1504.97","Christian schools but it's amazing that "],["1507.669","I could talk to the principal and to the "],["1510.25","teachers and say can we speak at your "],["1512.35","school and you know what out of the "],["1515.08","three mission trips of the Philippines "],["1516.85","I've only got rejected by one school "],["1519.159","because they didn't know me and they "],["1520.6","very well and I isn't that amazing how "],["1523.779","God does it so it's amazing the openness "],["1527.139","even in public schools you can share the "],["1529.419","Lord to share the Word of God share the "],["1531.759","gospel with the public schools in the "],["1534.19","Philippines and they are very open to "],["1536.049","death so add that to me that's amazing "],["1538.33","the Philippines is about 80 percent "],["1540.429","Roman Catholic and about 10 to 15 "],["1543.399","percent Protestant evangelical and about "],["1546.46","3/4 percent cult we'll discuss that "],["1548.2","later in about five percent Islamic so "],["1550.72","but thankful they are open for us to "],["1553.179","share the Word of God the second another "],["1556.09","I believe this is the last time they "],["1557.769","were there they painted our training "],["1560.71","center they painted our seminary "],["1562.509","building with a nice white color because "],["1564.789","it was very grey makes it look kind of "],["1566.559","dark but thankfully the team helped and "],["1569.97","painted it a nice white color so it's "],["1572.71","still but it could use a second coat so "],["1574.659","if you want to send the team over again "],["1576.7","we could use the second coat or our "],["1578.799","training center here is actually this is "],["1583.389","their at Grace Bible Academy here that's "],["1585.789","where our kids go to school actually at "],["1587.379","Grace Bible Academy and there's Bernard "],["1589.629","and pastor Larry we had a few people "],["1592.75","from say Civ Bible Church that joined "],["1595.059","the mission team and actually pastor "],["1596.409","Larry brought there's a guy named Dave "],["1598.75","Aaron's the two of them they there's a "],["1600.909","two-man mission team back in 2017 they "],["1603.549","did a pastors conference with the "],["1605.59","pastors and that was very special time "],["1608.139","back in May of 2017 "],["1609.639","so Sasa brought a mission team as well "],["1613.019","so it's it's a wonderful opportunity and "],["1615.85","we encourage if the Lord is leading you "],["1618.129","if there's another opportunity to come "],["1620.559","to do "],["1621.34","work as well and what it does is some "],["1625.66","people are asking is it beneficial to "],["1627.67","bring a mission team over and I think it "],["1630.01","is you know we we try to culturally you "],["1634.12","know there's some cultural differences "],["1635.02","that we want the team to be made aware "],["1637.09","of and things like that but we discuss "],["1639.16","all that and briefed them before they "],["1641.95","come over because it's important to know "],["1643.81","whatever what's happening because the "],["1646.06","thing is is this with our ministry we "],["1648.43","partner with different churches so it's "],["1650.41","encouraging that Americans come all this "],["1652.99","way to share the Word of God with the "],["1655.06","people there so it's really nice to have "],["1656.74","that opportunities what are the "],["1659.32","opportunities in the Philippines that's "],["1661.27","going on well like I said openness of "],["1663.4","the gospel like I mentioned earlier that "],["1666.97","even in public schools private schools "],["1669.79","whatever and there are we have some "],["1673.87","pastor friends that share the have Bible "],["1676.51","studies with the police with the army "],["1678.85","soldiers and things like that that is "],["1681.04","amazing that that'd be very hard to do "],["1683.71","in this country so in a way the "],["1685.6","Philippines is way more open than even "],["1687.67","in the United States we don't have the "],["1689.35","ACLU like you all do but whatever you do "],["1691.6","don't tell them how open it is in the "],["1693.82","Philippines they might try to come and "],["1695.2","transfer to the Philippines so anyway "],["1697.72","there's a big openness to the gospel in "],["1700.6","the Philippines and I tell pastors I say "],["1702.79","please take advantage of it now because "],["1705.61","you don't know when when that door could "],["1708.16","be shut when the government becomes "],["1709.87","hostile toward biblical Christianity but "],["1712.69","thankfully right now it is probably one "],["1714.37","of the most open countries in the world "],["1716.35","as far as sharing the gospel I don't "],["1719.14","have to be shy or you know worried about "],["1721.45","people you know you know being the "],["1724.78","government trying to spy on me that I'm "],["1726.55","a missionary so it's very open and "],["1728.38","there's a respect for missionaries and "],["1730.78","ministers in the Philippines also "],["1733.6","secondly in baguio in the neighboring "],["1736.03","mountain provinces where we have a "],["1737.47","ministry there's a strong evangelical "],["1739.69","presence "],["1740.26","my job as a missionaries to train "],["1742.18","pastors so guess what God has put me in "],["1745.39","a perfect place where we are in bag.you "],["1747.73","to Train pastors in the Philippines so "],["1750.39","I'm so thankful where I am in it it does "],["1753.94","help my wife is "],["1754.99","a Filipina so I feel like there's a in "],["1757.63","in the culture I feel a little bit more "],["1760.39","a part of their country and their "],["1762.279","society being that you know my kids are "],["1764.95","half Filipino and my wife is Filipino "],["1767.049","that really helps out a lot actually "],["1768.429","it's a very thankful for that that God "],["1770.47","has brought that in the Philippines "],["1772.419","where we live there are so many young "],["1774.85","people in colleges and that actually "],["1777.25","becomes a need because our ministries "],["1779.62","are trained pastors but I feel like I "],["1782.44","was sharing this with Kurt last night "],["1784.899","that I feel like there's a need that we "],["1788.38","would I would love to have a college "],["1790.36","minister in our ministry that would come "],["1793.27","and because in our city there's a lot of "],["1796.149","colleges that just goes to the colleges "],["1798.549","and set up College ministries there "],["1800.71","there are some pastors that do it but "],["1802.27","it's I feel like there's there's a big "],["1804.429","need and a big opportunity to bring that "],["1806.98","so that's a need that you might want to "],["1808.539","pray that God will bring up raise up a "],["1811.33","college minister that that could go and "],["1813.73","share like really do like evangelism and "],["1816.309","discipleship in the colleges so that's a "],["1818.529","big need that we have in our ministry "],["1820","but it's an opportunity as well what "],["1823.27","about some of the challenges that we "],["1824.47","have in the Philippines "],["1825.429","well like I meant like I mentioned there "],["1828.75","earlier is that there's a lot of false "],["1831.49","teaching in the Philippines a lot of "],["1834.25","openness but there's a lot of false "],["1835.72","teaching many groups teach that it's a "],["1840.399","work salvation you got to do something "],["1842.799","to go to heaven you got to be a water "],["1844","baptized or you got to join our church "],["1847.049","there's a group called iglesia knee "],["1849.37","Cristo it's translated Church of Christ "],["1851.71","but it's not the American Church of "],["1853.57","Christ this group denies the deity of "],["1856.059","Christ they don't believe that Jesus "],["1857.47","Christ is God and there's a guy in "],["1859.929","Mindanao it's called Kiba LOI you might "],["1862.929","have heard of him "],["1863.62","he is the self-proclaimed Son of God so "],["1867.159","he believes that he is the son of God "],["1868.96","and is funny you think that people would "],["1871.809","easily reject him but not he's got a big "],["1874.809","following actually unfortunately and "],["1877.029","he's a very blasphemous man who is "],["1879.19","claiming to be the Son of God so there's "],["1882.58","that in Islam is growing in the South "],["1885.639","and the Philippines and even if we're in "],["1888.34","our "],["1888.65","Biagio we've seen a big growth of Islam "],["1892.88","in the city of Baguio mainly because of "],["1895.97","economic opportunities because in their "],["1898.67","place there's not a lot of jobs there "],["1900.17","but in Baguio or we lived there's more "],["1902.24","opportunity so they're growing because "],["1904.82","of relocation there and they're having "],["1906.65","more kids and they're settling so it "],["1908.9","opens up opportunities and challenges to "],["1911.78","share the gospel with Muslim people so "],["1914.51","that's all it's a hard thing but yet "],["1916.46","maybe God will lead our pastors and us "],["1918.98","to be a part of that mission ministry as "],["1920.93","well thirdly the issue in the "],["1924.77","Philippines there's not very many I know "],["1927.02","there I've never met a Filipino that's "],["1928.91","agnostic or atheist I know there exist "],["1931.16","but there are very religious people but "],["1934.31","we know religion doesn't get you to "],["1936.23","heaven it's about having a relationship "],["1937.82","with the Lord Jesus Christ it's about "],["1939.44","putting your faith in the gospel and the "],["1941.81","death the burial and resurrection of our "],["1944.03","Lord Jesus Christ so the big issue in "],["1946.04","the Philippines is works versus grace so "],["1949.73","it's trying to understand that you are "],["1952.91","saved by grace your live your Christian "],["1955.61","life by grace and he will keep you in "],["1957.92","the end by grace so that is the biggest "],["1960.11","struggle that we have is sharing about "],["1963.35","grace and teaching about grace next "],["1966.8","slide

thing "],["26.53","I would like to say to the church being "],["29.92","in the military and finding a family "],["32.14","away from home is a hard thing it's "],["35.26","difficult but this church has given me "],["38.83","my wife my son family so thank you very "],["42.309","much for that that is a testimony of "],["44.77","your guys's ministry and I hope it "],["46.75","encourages you to minister to others is "],["48.25","wrong so thank you "],["50.019","the other thing I got to let you know is "],["51.85","you're gonna find out I'm like a ping "],["53.29","pong ball I like to move around my son "],["55.57","is very energetic I wonder where he gets "],["57.28","it from the other thing is I'm from New "],["59.92","England so I say some odd words "],["61.899","sometimes I say ideas instead of ideas "],["65.35","okay also when I get a little excited my "],["68.38","voice raises in pitch so instead of "],["70.509","sounding like a 42 year old man I'm "],["72.19","probably gonna sound like I'm 14 so I "],["73.869","apologize now that being said let's jump "],["78.67","in to our sermon today we're going to be "],["81.25","preaching out of Isaiah chapter 40 "],["83.08","verses 28 through 31 we're going to be "],["85.45","bouncing around a little bit between "],["87.43","Isaiah and Matthew but before we get "],["90.07","into it let's set some context down "],["91.689","let's talk about the Book of Isaiah some "],["94.689","biblical scholars have called the Book "],["96.159","of Isaiah a mini Bible so what we're "],["98.71","gonna do is we're gonna have a little "],["99.7","pop quiz don't worry the answers will be "],["102.13","on the screen my first question for you "],["104.89","guys is how many books are in the Bible "],["108.659","sixty-six you guys are all stars "],["110.89","alright sixty-six Bible books are in the "],["113.11","Bible did you know there are also 66 "],["115.18","chapters in the Book of Isaiah alright "],["118.93","we're gonna get a little bit more "],["119.77","difficult okay how many books are in the "],["122.259","Old Testament thirty-nine I see you guys "],["126.22","are catching on thirty-nine "],["127.6","there are also thirty-nine chapters and "],["130.63","the first half of the Book of Isaiah "],["133.049","both messages primarily focus on God's "],["136.299","judgment of sin with a little bit of "],["138.76","grace and hope sprinkled throughout my "],["142.18","next question is how many books are in "],["143.5","the New Testament twenty-seven "],["146.38","there are also 27 chapters in the second "],["150.01","half of the Book of Isaiah and both "],["152.86","message parallel because they both focus "],["156.43","on the Grace in love of God "],["159.19","Jewish rabbis also call this section of "],["162.17","the book of Isaiah the book of "],["163.37","consolation so now we learned a little "],["166.49","bit about the book let's talk about the "],["167.96","man the name Isaiah literally means "],["171.01","salvation of the Lord and this word "],["174.11","salvation can be defined from the "],["176.45","original text as deliverance and this is "],["179.36","the key message throughout the whole "],["181.1","book of Isaiah is that deliverance you "],["184.28","see Isaiah was a prophet sent to deliver "],["187.1","his people out of their trouble times he "],["190.91","was literally sent to give them God's "],["193.07","message of how to deal with life when it "],["196.4","knocks you down he was there to prepare "],["199.64","them not just for their troubled times "],["201.65","but also to prepare them for another "],["203.87","time of captivity basically to give them "],["206.69","hope and encouragement to stand up after "],["208.97","being knocked down so

circumstances rather than "],["231.23","who God is doesn't this happen to us "],["236.8","don't we act like this during a trying "],["239.39","time when life knocks us down here are "],["244.58","some examples in 1997 I went to my first "],["248","year award a Life Bible Institute and I "],["251.209","went there with the wrong attitude you "],["254.15","see growing up I defined myself as a "],["256.97","soccer player and I worked hard to be "],["260","the best I could be in my area when I "],["262.58","was 17 I got selected for a semi-pro "],["264.44","team down in North Carolina so when I "],["266.54","got to word of life I figured ah it's a "],["267.95","division 3 school I got this in the bag "],["270.169","this is what I'm going to do God had "],["273.5","other plans I ended up getting cut from "],["275.51","the first time in my life from anything "],["277.55","for somebody who identifies himself in "],["280.34","such a way and puts themselves in such a "],["282.5","a

Wisconsin and I'm working as an "],["294.059","aquatic director I was getting paid to "],["296.369","play in a pool with a bunch of kids life "],["298.079","was great but then the economy hit and "],["301.379","it crashed and the first industry to "],["304.379","take that hit was the entertainment area "],["306.209","I lost my job I couldn't find work "],["309.119","anywhere it came to the point where I "],["311.909","literally had to humble myself enough to "],["314.099","call my father-in-law and ask him if we "],["315.779","could move in with him until we got on "],["317.099","our feet fast forward a little bit more "],["320.339","in 2011 I've been in the Navy for about "],["323.849","a year and my wife and I were in "],["326.489","Portsmouth Naval Hospital expecting our

have an idea a little bit of what "],["351.929","trials happened how to get through it "],["354.629","that I have full experience that life is "],["357.809","gonna hit you hard and it's going to "],["359.519","knock you down but the question is is "],["362.099","how to God how does God help you see "],["365.489","it's a process I heard in a sermon a "],["367.649","couple weeks ago that the pastor used a "],["369.389","an illustration of it's a process much "],["372.059","like how a tree grows so how does a tree "],["375.389","girl before tree is planted there's "],["377.039","something that needs to be done so this "],["378.929","is the first time you jump to Matthew "],["380.399","someone ask you to jump to Matthew "],["381.629","chapter 13 verses 18 to 23 Matthew 13 "],["391.019","starting in verse 18 here then the "],["393.689","parable of the sower when hears the word "],["396.689","of the kingdom and does not understand "],["398.429","it the evil one comes and snatches them "],["401.159","away what has been sown in his heart "],["403.859","this is what was sown along the path as "],["408.029","for what was sown on rocky ground this "],["409.919","is the one who hears the word and "],["411.419","immediately receives it with joy yet he "],["414.599","has no root in himself he will endure "],["417.299","for a while and when tribulation or "],["419.729","persecution arises on the account of the "],["422.279","word immediately he falls away as "],["426.49","what was sown among the thorns this is "],["428.47","one who hears the word but the cares of "],["432.28","the world and the deceitfulness of the "],["434.56","riches choke the word right out of them "],["437.229","and it proves unfruitful as for what was "],["440.8","sown on good soil this is the one who "],["443.59","hears the word and understands it Dean "],["445.87","deed bears fruit and yields in one case "],["448.75","a hundredfold in another sixty and in "],["452.139","another thirty this is four examples of "],["455.65","the kind of heart that you can have as a "],["458.139","Christian your first blank there is "],["462.699","called a prepared heart you see before "],["465.34","anything can grow or be planted that "],["467.62","soil has to be prepared and a lot of "],["470.83","times God will allow something to come "],["472.81","into our life not to harm us or "],["474.699","persecute us but to perfect us part of "],["480.25","that process is turning our hearts in "],["482.38","much the same way a farmer will "],["484","cultivate his fields before our planting "],["485.979","can begin as Christ mentions there are "],["489.97","four types of hearts there's the one "],["491.919","that's along the path this is the person "],["494.289","who knows the word just knows the word "],["497.28","but then falls by the wayside they stray "],["500.05","away the second one the rocky ground is "],["502.75","a person who hears the word with joy but "],["505.15","there is no growth when hard times comes "],["508.75","they're done they run away "],["512.339","the third is among the thorns these are "],["515.919","people who are actual believers but they "],["518.079","allowed the temptation of sin to lead "],["520.36","them away from God and the truth of the "],["523.539","word of God is choked out of their "],["525.13","hearts what was once a burning fire from "],["527.44","salvation is now quenched the last is "],["534.459","what we want to strive to be like we "],["537.43","want to have good soil we want to be the "],["539.74","people that hear the word of God we "],["541.839","understand the Word of God but we bear "],["544.66","fruit through that understanding but "],["547.06","it's not just bearing fruit in our own "],["548.44","lives or in our own family it's bearing "],["551.079","fruit in other lives as well so that is "],["557.29","the soil that we want to have we want to "],["558.79","have that good "],["560.06","soyal that good heart you turn back now "],["562.76","to Isaiah chapter 40 we're gonna start "],["564.71","in verse 28 Isaiah 40 verse 28 have you "],["575.84","not known have you not heard the Lord is "],["578.78","the everlasting God the creator of the "],["581.24","ends of the earth he does not faint or "],["583.52","grow weary his understanding is "],["586.4","unsearchable he just power to the faint "],["590.03","and to him who has no might he increases "],["592.22","strength even use shall faint and be "],["596.51","weary and

"],["608.51","and not be weary they shall walk and not "],["611.51","be faint in the first part of verse 28 "],["616.01","it says have you not known have you not "],["620.51","heard this is the seed or the planted "],["626.27","heart you see the Israelites are coming "],["629.3","to Isaiah for answers they know that God "],["631.85","speaks through him and they want to hear "],["633.62","God's answer their lives have been "],["636.11","literally turned upside down by their "],["638.81","circumstances "],["640.84","God allows this to happen in your life "],["643.13","do you know why because he wants us to "],["645.86","see that he is the only one that can "],["649.13","turn us around and when we come to that "],["651.47","idea when we come to that spark when we "],["654.26","come to that seed that's when we were "],["656.96","ready for the next part and that's the "],["660.11","breakthrough or a progressing heart and "],["663.68","you can see that in the second half of "],["665.21","this verse through 29 it says the Lord "],["669.17","is the everlasting God the creator of "],["671.33","the ends of the earth he does not faint "],["673.43","or grow weary his understanding is "],["675.41","unsearchable he gives power to the faint "],["677.72","and to him who has no might he increases "],["679.88","strength "],["682.24","so this progressing heart this is where "],["684.98","the Israelites are coming and they are "],["686.93","ready for God to answer them and in "],["690.08","answer God through Isaiah reminds them "],["692.99","of who "],["693.889","he is do you know what happens when "],["701.629","you're reminded who God is when you're "],["703.069","in a trying time your focus shifts it "],["706.79","changes from what circumstances you're

the next step so God reminds them "],["730.79","of who he is so who does God say he is "],["732.769","he says he is the everlasting he says "],["736.249","it's because he wants to let the "],["737.569","Israelites know that there are no "],["740.239","boundaries for him time does not matter "],["742.73","he was here in the beginning and he will "],["744.529","be here long after the end

was a long way "],["1169.78","from land and it was being beaten by the "],["1172.33","waves for the wind was great against "],["1176.05","them and in the fourth watch of the "],["1180.97","night so

"],["1203.74","answered him lord if it is you command "],["1206.92","me to come to you on the water and he "],["1209.8","said come so Peter got out of the boat "],["1213.01","and walked on water and came to Jesus "],["1215.64","but when he saw the wind he was afraid "],["1218.59","and beginning to sink he cried out lord "],["1221.62","save me and Jesus immediately reached "],["1225.82","out with his hand and took hold of him "],["1228.59","saying to him oh you a little faith why "],["1231.169","did you doubt and when they got into the "],["1233.659","boat the wind ceased and those in the

were fishermen "],["1247.85","they spent their whole life on this "],["1251.029","water they've been through a couple "],["1252.77","storms if you read this over again when "],["1256.37","you go home today or even now I'm "],["1257.929","talking you will see that this storm was "],["1260.33","so bad that they got scared they got "],["1264.74","scared so badly that when they saw "],["1266.6","something walking to them they "],["1267.83","automatically thought in their in their "],["1269.87","human mind that this is a ghost coming "],["1271.37","to take us out we're gonna die this is "],["1274.19","it we're done and then Peter is a "],["1278.69","disciple that I like to affectionately "],["1280.669","say loves to put his foot in his mouth "],["1283.059","looks out and sees well if this is "],["1286.25","really Jesus because he told me not to "],["1287.899","be scared he'll cut call me and come out "],["1290.57","of the boat so Jesus calls him on his on "],["1294.529","his question and he steps out this is "],["1297.74","the thing about Peter you got to "],["1298.64","understand while he is focusing on God "],["1301.279","what is he doing he's walking on water "],["1305.74","he's going to his Savior he's going to "],["1309.919","God as long as he stays focusing on him "],["1314.74","but she got to understand Peter is just "],["1316.88","human Peter gets distracted by the wind "],["1320.99","and the water and it's probably raining "],["1323.69","and he's getting pelted and he's "],["1325.19","beginning to get scared himself and what "],["1326.87","does he do he takes his focus off of God "],["1329.57","and it goes to his circumstances and "],["1333.44","what happens immediately he sinks and "],["1337.179","this is the one great thing the one "],["1339.5","smart thing Peter does that I wish I "],["1341.419","could do every time I hit a trial every "],["1343.429","time I focused on my circumstances he "],["1345.62","doesn't call to the boat to come and get "],["1347.75","him he cries out lord save me and then "],["1351.86","Jesus makes the first lifeguard rescue "],["1353.929","recorded in history he walks out reaches "],["1357.08","down picks him up and saves him and "],["1361.7","not only does he do that but he takes "],["1363.679","him back to the boat to safety and the "],["1365.809","second he steps in the boat what happens "],["1368.71","everything calms the circumstances go "],["1371.299","away that is the key in this is that "],["1376.72","Peter had to focus on

over first book of the New "],["35.34","Testament Matthew chapter 6 these are "],["37.71","all the words of Jesus and let's speak "],["40.14","to him in prayer he breathes out this "],["41.699","word after all shall we pray Lord Jesus "],["46.44","we acknowledge your presence in this "],["48.93","room and Lord we know that in your "],["51.059","presence is perfect peace and I pray "],["54.6","that you would give us a heightened "],["56.159","awareness of your presence with us today "],["58.26","and just now Lord I pray for myself and "],["61.5","for all of us that we would "],["62.58","intentionally yield our wills our "],["65.299","emotions our desires our plans our "],["68.4","everything that you've given us right "],["70.11","back to you if we pray Lord that you "],["72.57","would have full reign in our hearts and "],["74.58","minds we want to leave this place "],["76.619","transformed and more like Jesus and we "],["78.93","ask Lord that we would be usable in your "],["80.939","hands to make a difference in this "],["82.56","extremely needy world and so be "],["85.02","glorified as we attempt to worship you "],["86.729","with our hearts with our minds we pray "],["89.159","all this in the most excellent name of "],["91.259","Jesus and all God's people said amen "],["93.799","praise the Lord Matthew chapter 6 if you "],["98.969","were to log on to a Google search engine "],["101.219","and type in worry wo RR Y probably some "],["106.2","of you are doing it as I speak just to "],["107.789","check me out on this I did that recently "],["110.31","and let me ask you how many entries do "],["113.069","you suppose you would find there under "],["115.71","worry imagine people can do this all "],["118.319","around the world right I found a hundred "],["122.219","and fourteen million entries on the word "],["126.689","worried what does that tell us about our "],["128.22","world this is an issue isn't it we're "],["132.15","worried about worried so this is a "],["134.76","relevant issue the Lord Jesus is fully "],["136.92","aware of that in fact because worry is "],["139.5","so pervasive and especially in our "],["141.54","society here we see a lot of it most "],["144.24","people think that worry is normal it's "],["147.75","the norm everybody's doing it I mean "],["149.31","come on 114 million this is an it's "],["152.76","everybody's agenda you might say right "],["155.03","I mean after all is it not normal to "],["159.11","worry about making the grade in school "],["163.42","or losing a job or having adequate "],["169.37","income during retirement is it not "],["173.8","normal to worry about a failing marriage "],["178.459","or being rejected by peers or facing the "],["183.41","future all alone "],["185.42","is it not normal my friends to worry "],["189.11","about crime on the streets declining "],["192.35","health getting smothered in debt and I "],["196.4","can go on and on and multiply that list "],["198.11","but I don't want to depress us too badly "],["199.52","right there's enough to worry about if "],["201.86","you choose to focus on problems you're "],["204.26","making a choice probably to worry and so "],["208.04","as we think about these issues and "],["209.66","there's more as I say I have to ask the "],["211.91","question to myself and to you what are "],["215.72","you anxious about what causes you to "],["221.6","worry and honestly is your worry normal "],["225.17","is that the norms is what the Lord wants "],["227.63","for us I want to distinguish before we "],["232.04","go any further between two concepts one "],["234.739","is worry the other is concerned let's "],["236.81","talk about concern for a moment okay "],["238.88","what is concern well it's to have notice "],["241.489","the word a healthy interest in something "],["245.57","that is important to you it's not bad in "],["249.38","fact if you think of the contrast if "],["250.94","you're not concerned about anything "],["252.17","you're what you're apathetic that's no "],["254.03","good we should be concerned about things "],["256.609","on the other hand what about worry look "],["260.419","at the definition there to become "],["261.859","anxious over disturbing thoughts that "],["264.59","may or may not come to pass I believe "],["267.77","worry is a form of here the word self "],["270.97","torment we bring this upon ourselves the "],["274.669","problems are in the world that's always "],["276.02","going to be the case sparks are always "],["277.58","flying no matter where you live the "],["280.19","question is how do we respond to them "],["282.47","right "],["282.86","if you traced out the meaning of the "],["285.44","word worry there's a German cognate it's "],["288.34","virgon I believe and those who have a "],["290.139","German background please correct me "],["291.669","later I think it's a virgon and that "],["293.65","word means to strangle very apt picture "],["297.97","there because worried if left unchecked "],["301.47","strangles are thoughts "],["303.4","it chokes our emotions and it even "],["307.15","devours our physical health now does the "],["309.94","Lord Jesus know about this sure he does "],["311.65","he came down here wrapped himself in "],["313.78","flesh and rubbed elbows with the likes "],["315.58","of us he knows our condition and out of "],["318.55","compassion for us what he does in this "],["321.4","particular text is he exposes worry for "],["324.58","what it truly is so we can get a real "],["326.2","good look at it "],["326.95","because like I say just by default we "],["328.75","worry but we don't take time to think "],["331.389","what am i doing what is this actually "],["333.1","why is this affecting me and he's going "],["335.26","to expose it for us and then "],["336.97","compassionately he's going to issue a "],["338.71","very simple command to all of us self "],["341.2","included and the command simply is do "],["344.85","not worry sister brother do not worry "],["351.63","you say well yeah I want to get there "],["354.28","but I need some motivation why should I "],["357.91","not worry do you have any reasons for me "],["359.53","I personally don't we can go home well "],["362.139","no don't go yet Jesus has some reasons "],["365.5","for us in this text you'll see them in "],["367.36","fact the first one's very right up front "],["368.95","here you'll see it and that is worry is "],["371.74","on reasonable why should I not worry "],["374.979","because it's unreasonable worry is "],["377.919","unreasonable look at the text you'll see "],["380.289","it look at verse 25 we're in chapter 6 "],["382.45","of Matthew Jesus says for this reason I "],["387.34","say to you do not be worried about your "],["390.55","life as to what you will eat or what you "],["393.52","will drink nor for your body as to what "],["396.4","you will put on is not life more than "],["399.7","food and the body more than clothing "],["403.09","notice verse 25 he says for this reason "],["405.669","I say to you for what reason "],["407.52","well if you look at the previous verse "],["409.539","there in verse 24 he says you cannot "],["413.05","serve god and riches or Mammon or wealth "],["416.229","depending on your translation in other "],["418.599","words you can't serve both either serve "],["420.52","God or serve money which one is it "],["422.26","be and therefore since you can't serve "],["426.1","both don't worry about serving riches "],["428.47","serve God and guess what he will supply "],["431.98","your needs and the question is do you "],["434.5","trust him to do so is he ready willing "],["436.6","and able to do so sure he is this is not "],["439.57","a get-rich-quick scheme I'm not talking "],["441.46","about health and wealth gospel here but "],["443.5","in terms of our basic necessities he's "],["446.02","got us covered already do you know what "],["448.27","you're gonna have for dinner six days "],["449.68","from now I don't I have a feeling I'll "],["453.19","be eating six days from now should the "],["454.9","Lord tarry and not return before then "],["457.68","he's got me covered right he's got you "],["459.94","covered as well and so as we look at "],["462.4","this particular text I want you to open "],["463.96","up your heart and your mind and to "],["465.64","embrace what Jesus is asking of you and "],["468.16","of me notice the question there is not "],["470.68","life more than food he's reasoning from "],["474.31","the greater to the lesser is not your "],["476.53","existence of more value than mere food "],["479.83","what good is food to a dead person right "],["482.86","food is intended to preserve life to "],["485.5","nourish and then he asks and the body is "],["489.61","not the body greater than clothing if "],["491.95","God gave us the greater life and a body "],["494.29","then you can count on it he certainly "],["496.24","can give us the lesser food and clothing "],["500.14","again what good is clothing without a "],["503.08","body you can hang it on a mannequin I "],["505.51","guess but if you don't have a body you "],["506.74","can't wear it right look at verse 26 "],["509.1","Jesus says look at the birds of the air "],["512.58","that they do not sow nor reap nor gather "],["515.71","into barns and yet your heavenly Father "],["517.93","feeds them are you not worth much more "],["521.83","than they birds do not engage in the "],["525.7","normal cycle of producing food you know "],["527.8","planting harvesting store I've never "],["529.69","seen birds do this storing up grain I "],["531.97","don't see that they're trusting the Lord "],["534.61","right they're not doing farming and so "],["538.21","if that's the case maybe there's a "],["540.76","lesson we can learn from the birds "],["543.1","notice the pronoun it's something that "],["545.47","we normally would skip right over but "],["546.88","don't miss that he says and your your "],["550.33","heavenly Father feeds them and so with "],["553.57","the act of creation God assumed the "],["555.67","respond "],["556.75","to provide for his creatures so again "],["560.89","I'm not a scientist a biologist and "],["563.35","nutritionist I'm just a humble preacher "],["565.24","but let me say this I believe that "],["568.63","everything your body needs to function "],["570.52","is somewhere on this planet and God put "],["573.22","it there so if you need vitamin C for "],["576.19","whatever reason "],["576.94","again I'm not have another biologist I "],["578.56","don't know but I know vitamin C is good "],["580.27","for you well pick an orange God deposit "],["582.76","it there do you need vitamin D well pick "],["584.92","help me out what else under you can "],["586","drink what else has vitamin D what all "],["590.32","right there you go sunlight vitamin E "],["592.48","what are the little seeds you can eat "],["593.8","the sunflower seeds right and on and on "],["596.05","it goes the point is is this all "],["597.34","coincidence or did God intentionally "],["599.59","place provision for this wonderful "],["601.74","machine he engineered called the human "],["604.45","body it's all there he took it on his "],["607.03","shoulders to be responsible enough to "],["609.13","provide for his children not only what "],["611.35","physical needs but also with spiritual "],["614.32","needs he thought all this through he's "],["615.79","got us covered my friends we're back to "],["618.01","that same old question do I trust him or "],["621.88","do I have to fret and worry and do "],["623.17","something about it myself because he's "],["624.97","not able or willing do I trust him he's "],["628.42","got us covered your heavenly Father "],["629.92","feeds them now the birds if you think "],["633.64","about it they gather enough for today "],["635.08","they trust her creator for tomorrow's "],["636.7","provision but he says he is your father "],["640.69","you see the birds know him as creator if "],["644.83","you know Christ as Savior then he's your "],["647.8","Savior you have a father the birds can't "],["650.56","say that we've got the edge on them "],["652.24","don't we there's something special about "],["653.83","human beings in our relationship with "],["656.71","the Lord so when I think about the birds "],["660.67","who only know him as creator and we have "],["663.64","the advantage of not only knowing him as "],["665.11","creator but as Savior and father and yet "],["668.62","they're not in a panic and we are hello "],["671.49","there's something we can learn from the "],["674.47","birds you know we hear the expression "],["675.52","boys that guy a birdbrain well actually "],["677.8","it should be a compliment because "],["679.33","sometimes birds seem to be wiser than us "],["681.54","maybe we're the bird brains if you know "],["683.83","what I mean and so this is just a lesson "],["686.35","from nature "],["687.34","by the way Palestine was the crossroads "],["689.53","of "],["689.74","bird migration and so Jesus probably "],["691.84","just saw them and said look at those "],["693.1","birds right there then he says are you "],["696.16","its emphatic not worth much more than "],["699.82","they reasoning from the lesser the birds "],["702.01","to the greater humans in God's eyes we "],["704.05","are worth far more than animals "],["705.7","animals and humans as I say can claim "],["709.51","him as creator we've got something "],["711.07","special going on guess why because we're "],["714.07","made in God's image we're a reflection "],["716.74","of him right and so there's something "],["718.96","precious about that and again only save "],["721.93","humans enjoy that father-child "],["723.67","relationship so the birds are probably "],["725.56","envious now look at verse 27 and who of "],["730.54","you by being worried can add a single "],["734.59","hour to his life "],["737.26","you may have a translation that says can "],["739.42","add a single qubit that's one and a half "],["741.1","feet but this is used metaphorically if "],["743.35","you have the NIV it says a single hour "],["745.12","in other words can you add time to your "],["747.97","life now think about it for a minute see "],["750.34","the phrase there - his lifespan "],["752.4","it's unreasonable to think that anyone "],["754.87","can lengthen their life by worry "],["757.75","in fact worrying doesn't lengthen life "],["759.85","it does what hello shortens it doesn't "],["762.73","it do we realize what we're doing to "],["764.2","ourselves we're shortening our own lives "],["765.72","see this is not reasonable is it if you "],["768.49","really think it through and that's what "],["769.66","Jesus is doing again he's putting it out "],["771.64","in the sunlight and saying look at worry "],["773.23","for what it really is you really want to "],["775.15","go there it's not reasonable think it "],["778.03","through that's his request and so as we "],["782.17","think it through we realize you know we "],["784.78","can't worry ourselves to life we can "],["787.84","only worry ourselves to death now "],["791.05","Charles Mayo of the famous Mayo Clinic "],["792.91","once wrote this he writes worry affects "],["796.87","the circulation the heart the glands and "],["800.5","the whole nervous system I have never "],["804.49","known a man to die of overwork but I "],["807.7","have known a lot who died of worry so "],["812.74","tell me what good thing does worry "],["814.84","accomplish well if you if your goal is "],["818.35","to get an ulcer it might be who you want "],["820.21","high blood pressure it might be good for "],["821.71","that there's "],["822.73","think good about it right in fact as we "],["825.13","go along and see what where he is we're "],["826.75","just exploring the tip of the iceberg "],["828.31","right now we're going to see ultimately "],["829.57","it's sin really but hang in there with "],["832.57","me there's a couple of angles I want to "],["833.98","approach here so as I think through "],["836.889","worry I've got to say why am I doing "],["838.72","this it's not reasonable and so here's "],["841.75","how we can begin to train ourselves as "],["844.87","you start to worry as that panic kicks "],["846.97","in train yourself to ask this question "],["849.06","again then you're not gonna hear the "],["850.69","word easy from me right I'm not saying "],["852.91","any of this is easy but if we stay at it "],["854.98","long enough and intentionally rely on "],["856.42","the Spirit of God he can transform us "],["858.79","and get us where we need to be at least "],["860.829","making progress so do I have reason to "],["863.98","worry ask yourself that question as you "],["866.139","begin to worry just like an alarm clock "],["868.089","train yourself hey I'm starting to worry "],["870.25","now do I really have good reason to "],["872.26","worry or to paraphrase it do I really "],["874.3","have good reason to torment myself "],["876.1","what's the answer obviously and oh right "],["879.25","and so the Lord is trying to show us "],["882.49","that worry is unreasonable and this is "],["884.199","why Jesus is saying dear child hello "],["886.72","do not worry I've got you covered "],["890.079","and by the way worry is unreasonable so "],["892.449","that's one reason why we should not "],["893.769","worry "],["894.25","but there's another you'll see it in the "],["896.35","text and that is worry is on belief "],["901.019","worry believe it or not my friends "],["903.819","it is according to the Lord unbelief now "],["906.699","look with me please at verse 28 and "],["909.04","notice what Jesus asks here verse 28 and "],["913.47","why are you worried about clothing "],["917.069","observe how the lilies of the field grow "],["919.36","they do not toil nor do they spin yet I "],["922.839","say to you that not even Solomon in all "],["925.66","his glory clothed himself like one of "],["929.319","these see the expression there verse 28 "],["931.899","they do not toil they do not spin toil "],["936.19","refers to laboring in the fields to "],["937.899","collect clothing material whatever that "],["939.55","is cotton or you name it they're not "],["941.589","doing that and then further they do not "],["943.569","spin that refers to the process of "],["945.459","making clothing you see the wildfowlers "],["947.41","they have no part in adorning themselves "],["949.42","somebody else is clothing them and in "],["952.87","such a glorious way a couple days "],["956.55","I happen to hear a scientist I've never "],["959.459","done this but he did he took a petal "],["962.37","from a lily and put it under a "],["964.05","microscope and looked at it and he said "],["966","it's stunning it's beautiful it looks "],["967.589","like little diamonds I guess the "],["969.18","material whatever you want to call it "],["970.5","God weaved it in such a way that it "],["972.42","looks like diamonds so it's pretty "],["974.339","beautiful and that's the comparison here "],["976.8","now let's talk about our friend Solomon "],["980.01","notice he says there even Solomon in all "],["982.769","of his glory did not clothe himself like "],["984.81","one of these lilies you might say so if "],["987.39","you want to put it down for your notes "],["988.769","you can at second chronicles chapter 9 "],["990.92","verses 23 and 24 it says their second "],["994.74","kron 9 23 24 and all the kings of the "],["998.64","earth were seeking the presence of "],["1001.39","solomon why to hear his wisdom which god "],["1005.3","had put in his heart and they brought "],["1008.3","every man his gift think about the gifts "],["1010.519","now articles of silver and gold garments "],["1015.11","so much year by year they're bringing "],["1018.29","the designer stuff every year to solomon "],["1020.899","you know help me out i'm not a "],["1022.459","fashionable guy gucci Versace help me "],["1026.48","out Walmart Kmart all that cool stuff "],["1030.11","that's what I wear you know spotlight "],["1032.24","you know Kmart special there you go nice "],["1034.1","shirt so the point is he was one "],["1037.37","well-dressed dude he had way more "],["1039.199","closets filled with clothes and he can "],["1041.449","wear in a given year right and he's "],["1043.79","saying when you look at the lilies and "],["1045.26","how beautiful God clothed them Solomon's "],["1048.079","wearing racks there's no contest here so "],["1050.84","you see the logic now this is the point "],["1053.12","you know solomon's regal wardrobe "],["1055.76","there's just no match for God's "],["1056.96","handiwork the pristine beauty of the "],["1059.54","wild flowers which God had clothes can't "],["1062.72","be improved upon the old expression you "],["1064.49","old-timers will know this one you cannot "],["1067.16","gild the lily don't put gold on God's "],["1070.16","beautiful work "],["1071.63","you're gonna mess it up it's too "],["1073.52","stunning for that first 30 but if God so "],["1078.62","clothes the grass of the field which is "],["1080.419","alive today and tomorrow is thrown into "],["1082.25","the furnace will he not much more clothe "],["1085.01","you you of little faith "],["1089.44","now wood was scarce in Palestine and so "],["1091.9","the wildflowers they were gathered from "],["1093.58","the field they were actually put in "],["1095.5","their column fireplaces really it's "],["1098.2","their pottery ovens and they would use "],["1100.36","it as

"],["1496.04","us just the opposite here but in defense "],["1499.07","of the unbeliever if you think from from "],["1501.59","their perspective think it through from "],["1503.9","the way they see it

turn in your copies of the "],["76.28","Word of God or your iPads or phones to "],["79.119","Luke 7 beginning in verse 36 I think "],["83.33","this is a passage that it's just so "],["85.61","insightful and it portrays the gospel in "],["89.03","such a clear way there are two "],["91.76","individuals and they and they both come "],["93.44","to Jesus and the one way you think that "],["97.73","is the appropriate way that's the "],["99.29","natural way is actually the wrong way "],["102.56","and the one that looks so inappropriate "],["104.87","that's actually the one the the person "],["107.72","that leaves blessed and leaves forgiven "],["110.24","it's very interesting and so let's start "],["112.9","Luke 7 beginning in verse 36 one of the "],["118.19","Pharisees asked him that's Jesus to eat "],["122.27","with him and he went into the Pharisees "],["124.19","house and took his place at the table "],["126.979","and behold a woman of the city who was a "],["130.61","sinner when she learned that he was "],["133.04","reclining at the table in the Pharisees "],["134.81","house brought an alabaster flask of "],["137.209","ointment and standing behind him at his "],["140.12","feet weeping she began to wet his feet "],["142.76","with her tears and wiped them with the "],["145.549","hair pair of her head and kissed his "],["148.159","feet and anointed them with the ointment "],["150.28","now when the Pharisee who had invited "],["152.45","him saw this he said to himself if this "],["154.819","man were a prophet he would have known "],["157.34","who "],["158.27","what sort of woman this is who is "],["160.34","touching him for she is a sinner and "],["163.48","jesus answered answering said to him "],["166.55","Simon I have something to tell you and "],["169.84","he said say it teacher a certain "],["173.63","moneylender had two debtors onenote five "],["176.72","hundred denarii and the other fifty and "],["180.11","when they could not pay he canceled the "],["182.06","debt of both now which of them will love "],["185","him more Simon answered the one I "],["188.63","suppose for whom he canceled the larger "],["190.85","debt and he said to him you have judged "],["192.44","rightly then turning toward the woman he "],["195.62","said to Simon do you see this woman I "],["198.5","entered your house you gave me no water "],["201.14","for my feet but she has wet my feet with "],["203.39","her tears and wiped them with her hair "],["205.58","he gave me no kiss but from the time I "],["208.04","came in she has not ceased to kiss my "],["210.11","feet you did not anoint my head with oil "],["212.45","but she has anointed my feet with "],["214.07","ointment therefore I tell you her sins "],["217.31","which are many are forgiven for she has "],["220.43","loved much but he who is forgiven little "],["222.92","loves little and he said to her your "],["226.04","sins are forgiven then those who were at "],["230.18","the table with him began to say among "],["232.16","themselves who is this who even forgives "],["235.01","sins and he said to the woman your faith "],["237.56","has saved you go in peace amen "],["241.87","father God I thank you for your word I "],["245.21","thank you for your great love and your "],["248.09","great grace which cancels debts I pray "],["250.82","God that this morning "],["252.08","your spirit would be in this place God "],["253.88","you would convict our hearts God you "],["256.16","would reveal to us our sin and you draw "],["258.89","us to love you more than we did when we "],["261.65","came in this morning I pray God that you "],["264.5","would help me to deliver this clearly "],["266.57","and correctly and

question is who what "],["291.229","religion you "],["292.169","identify with and it seems there's a "],["294.27","little debate if whether those people "],["296.039","are actually you know churched people or "],["298.59","actually there were nominal Christians "],["300.33","now going none but but nevertheless "],["302.52","there seems to be a trend in that "],["304.59","direction towards secularization toward "],["308.249","people finding existence and meaning "],["310.86","apart from God and we see that but I "],["314.669","find it very interesting that no matter "],["316.349","what religion you identify with or "],["318.99","whether you're non-religious everyone "],["321.689","seems to admire Jesus "],["324.83","everyone likes Jesus if you ask the "],["328.589","average person

will affirm that he was a great "],["339.659","teacher who gave us a very high morality "],["342.27","I mean Jesus he gave us the golden rule "],["345.689","right do unto others as you would have "],["348.419","them do unto you who would who would "],["349.71","argue that's wrong that's false morality "],["353.069","he taught us to love your enemies right "],["356.279","to bless those who curse you and he said "],["359.399","love your neighbor as yourself these are "],["363.599","great teachings right that almost all "],["366.029","non-christians will agree with us these "],["368.46","are good things to reach for and there "],["370.469","aren't too many other religions that can "],["372.659","give a comparable morality that Jesus "],["375.719","gave so in this passage I don't think we "],["378.87","should be surprised that a certain "],["381.029","Pharisee is very interested in Jesus "],["384.68","verse 36 tells us one of the Pharisees "],["388.86","asked him to eat with him and he went "],["391.74","into the Pharisees house and reclined at "],["393.33","the table "],["394.49","the Pharisees we all know they were the "],["396.87","religious elites in the day they were "],["399.509","highly zealous for the law "],["400.8","we often kind of looked down on them "],["403.05","right for their hypocrisy and the way "],["405.419","Jesus treated them but right they were "],["409.289","very zealous for the law and the "],["410.909","ordinances in the Old Testament right "],["412.819","has to be commended right the problem "],["415.979","was they started making rules on top of "],["418.169","rules right sorry saying the Bible "],["421.379","didn't necessarily say you had to do "],["422.759","this but to be extra safe we're going to "],["425.279","draw "],["425.83","this line right here and it kind of "],["427.06","makes sense if there's a cliff you don't "],["429.73","want to be playing right up next to the "],["430.93","cliff maybe you build a fence you know a "],["433.03","little bit behind the cliff so if you "],["434.47","fall off you don't die right that's the "],["436.39","kind of logic at least the Pharisees had "],["438.52","and while many of the Pharisees they "],["441.52","hated Jesus and they hated how he took "],["444.76","their power from them with the people "],["446.88","this man Simon what's his attitude "],["449.5","toward Jesus you know some think that "],["454.27","because Simon he didn't honor Jesus the "],["457.93","way he would have honored some of the "],["459.34","most revered leaders in his day some "],["462.58","think that this was like an intentional "],["464.44","way to slight Jesus now this whole "],["468.46","inviting him over to lunch was a way to "],["470.08","kind of publicly embarrass him I'm not "],["472.48","giving you the treatment I would an "],["474.01","honored guest it's possible right text "],["478.57","doesn't really say there's kind of some "],["480.49","space to read between the lines and kind "],["482.74","of form opinions I personally think that "],["486.13","Simon much like everyone today right was "],["490.66","very intrigued by Jesus maybe he even "],["493.66","liked him and why not Jesus is no doubt "],["497.41","an intriguing person right he is and in "],["501.55","his day he's drawing all these crowds to "],["503.5","him people are flocking so popular with "],["506.23","the people and he's doing miracles right "],["509.83","there's this element of the supernatural "],["511.66","which is maybe when you want to see him "],["514.21","do a miracle when you want to see if "],["515.38","this is actually true what he's doing on "],["518.86","top of all that he has a very "],["520.09","interesting teaching he's kind of "],["522.37","spinning the the law and the prophets in "],["524.56","a different light and it is typically "],["526.9","understood so it makes total sense that "],["531.19","a religious man like Simon and an "],["532.84","intellectual guy would want to have "],["534.94","lunch with Jesus why not maybe he wants "],["538.57","to pick his brain on some theology "],["540.94","that's what I would be very interested I "],["542.83","like to ask Jesus a few questions like "],["544.18","what does this mean maybe you want some "],["546.94","moral tips on how Simon could lead a "],["549.25","better life right it's all possible but "],["552.58","doesn't really say I will say that "],["554.59","unlike some of the other Pharisees we do "],["557.23","not see this guy "],["559.31","Simon we don't see him try to trap Jesus "],["561.47","in any way we don't see him try to you "],["564.44","know undermine him or pose this question "],["566.029","to make him look bad from from what we "],["569.45","have in the in the Bible it seems like a "],["571.01","very natural just man-to-man talk right "],["575","having a meal together that's a good "],["576.74","thing having meal yields are good and "],["580.63","then this woman comes right and what's "],["583.91","her deal "],["584.47","and she had somehow found out that Jesus "],["587.06","was at this Pharisees home and she comes "],["591.32","there with this alabaster jar of perfume "],["593.39","which was something precious to her "],["596.92","something valuable and what she started "],["599.15","doing starts making this

"],["917.36","those who are forgiven little loves "],["919.589","little as a profound statement by Jesus "],["923.309","and the implication is right the "],["925.049","opposite of that is those who

"],["947.16","partner but then there's Simon over "],["950.879","there and the text kind of reads as if "],["954.259","this Pharisee he cannot love Jesus much "],["958.499","poor guy I mean Simon he wasn't really "],["960.819","that bad of a sinner in the first place "],["962.22","he didn't really need forgiveness so he "],["965.499","couldn't really love Jesus the way this "],["967.72","woman did right it's kind of how it "],["969.369","reads that is the way the story kind of "],["973.629","goes is he he had a little bit of sin "],["975.129","and this woman had a lot of sin so Simon "],["978.309","would have to go and sin in a terrible "],["980.259","way right and then come back and then "],["981.489","he'd be able to receive the forgiveness "],["982.66","and then he'd be able to

case "],["996.959","Bible is quite brutal on his assessment "],["1000.809","of human nature Jeremiah tells us "],["1003.959","famously that the human heart is "],["1005.759","deceitful above all

"],["1064.769","Simon right in this passage so the "],["1068.73","reality of this past is just a little "],["1069.929","obscured right first glance it seems "],["1071.909","like poor guy he can't love Jesus much "],["1075.38","because he doesn't send much but the "],["1077.82","truth is what both Simon and the woman "],["1081.539","sin much both have much sin maybe they "],["1085.47","sinned in different ways "],["1087.149","maybe they "],["1089.02","with different degrees of severity but "],["1092.44","both send much the tragedy is only the "],["1097.27","woman recognizes it and only the

he's the one who's righteous who "],["1144.07","exposes the depths of their depravity "],["1148.92","Simon can't see it and we're not so "],["1153.1","different from Simon today are we we "],["1157.57","talked about in the beginning how the "],["1159.04","world is very much attracted to Jesus at "],["1161.5","a distance right everybody admires his "],["1164.26","teachings you know and

you're not communicating so there is "],["241.16","a connection between us and God and so "],["244.97","we we take it as a practice when we see "],["248.66","you know people singing a good prayer we "],["254.239","just say - I see Jesus praying in John "],["260.269","17 that but people who follow him would "],["266.33","become one "],["268.04","just as he the Holy Spirit and the

"],["638.7","his life became in danger that he is "],["644.339","serving the God who made heaven and "],["650.459","earth and acknowledge the fact that the "],["657.54","reason why people's life are

you "],["853.1","secondly you can avoid Jonah prayer by "],["862.98","letting your heart beat with the same "],["869.22","motivation that God has God is motivated "],["874.4","by love he came down

"],["916.22","angry because he's not motivated by the "],["924.3","same thing that motivates God Paul tells "],["928.86","us in in 2nd Corinthians 5 that the love "],["932.37","of Christ constrains us

you not you going "],["1687.76","to pray Jonah's prayer and this is a "],["1690.67","prayer that you don't want to say and so "],["1695.11","with I went back my dad started a church "],["1698.5","in 1977 the Jerusalem Baptist Church and "],["1702.72","in when I got back in one month one "],["1706.9","church at one church it's like in one "],["1710.32","month we had 300 new people coming to "],["1713.8","the church there were people who were "],["1715.87","scattered nothing was happening at the "],["1717.97","church but they find that new leader and "],["1719.83","the Lord had been using me and so Lord "],["1723.04","really blessed we'd build another church "],["1725.08","but I felt that the Lord's direction for "],["1732.58","me was not to fill the pews but as we "],["1736.63","had people walking to three hours to "],["1739.81","come to church I mobilized the church "],["1743.95","member to use the places where those "],["1747.58","people were coming from as a mission "],["1751.36","field some damn week "],["1753.28","acquire the back of a truck they went "],["1756.49","and evangelize for three days and and "],["1760.48","they come back sometime we walk three "],["1763.18","hour for one day and we shared their "],["1766.72","gospel and I say simple principle of "],["1769.57","just evangelism you just evangelize "],["1772.87","people we just nurtured a new believer "],["1775.69","we trained a leader and we plant new "],["1779.95","churches I have a story about a church "],["1782.65","that we went to we have the church it's "],["1785.5","one of our largest church it's like we "],["1788.08","went on a Sunday afternoon and there was "],["1790.72","a cockfight people were bad we got a "],["1795.94","chance to share the gospel with the "],["1797.38","leader and you know what happened he got "],["1799.69","save his family got saved we we we we "],["1802.87","studied a church at his house and the "],["1807.31","place where they used to have the "],["1808.69","cockfight we purchased it and right now "],["1811.9","it is one of our largest church so I "],["1814.27","believe that I believe that every every "],["1820.3","person on the

"],["1835.03","disciple maker and if you a disciple "],["1838.63","maker your house should be a potential "],["1841.66","church and that's why that's why from "],["1845.88","1996 to now one church has

"],["144.4","get to eat the food that we've been "],["145.72","missing so it's great to be here with "],["147.64","you today I want to talk to you about a "],["150.4","scripture verse that's pretty common and "],["154.629","I'm sure you guys have heard it before "],["155.8","my objective today "],["158.12","is we're not going to like dig in and "],["161.09","get a big exegesis my objective today is "],["163.73","to just simply stir your hearts for the "],["166.58","Great Commission and to share some "],["168.41","stories with you about the impact that "],["170.54","faith Bible is having around the world "],["172.55","through through they're partnering with "],["174.62","missionaries such as ourselves so let's "],["177.56","look at it the Great Commission this is "],["179.3","what it says Matthew chapter 28 then "],["182.03","Jesus came to them and said all "],["183.44","authority in heaven and on earth has "],["186.08","been given to me therefore go and make "],["188.66","disciples of all nations baptizing them "],["191.48","in the name of the Father and the Son "],["193.04","and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to "],["195.68","obey everything I have commanded you and "],["197.87","surely I am with you always to the very "],["200.51","end of the age so the Great Commission "],["203.48","is quite simply just the mandate that "],["205.519","God gave to all believers to go and "],["208.25","share the gospel and this is important "],["211.34","to Jesus he reiterates it in mark "],["213.26","chapter 16 and he gives kind of a little "],["215.45","bit different version of it in Acts "],["217.73","chapter 1 before he ascends into heaven "],["220.28","so it's something that he really wanted "],["222.35","his people to understand and I want to "],["226.579","just share with you what is it I was "],["228.98","thinking about this as I was looking "],["230.329","over this verse where he says teaching "],["232.4","them to obey everything I have commanded "],["233.959","you so I was thinking about that what is "],["235.94","it that he has commanded us to teach "],["239.39","what is it that Jesus was teaching his "],["242.15","disciples and if we look through "],["243.709","Scripture we can see that the the story "],["247.549","of Jesus is not just something that took "],["250.13","place you know his three and a half "],["253.04","years here on earth but he actually "],["254.57","taught a lot out of the Old Testament "],["256.19","and then the disciples got to walk "],["258.5","through with him so what we preach is we "],["261.229","preach the full gospel from Genesis to "],["264.47","revelations and so that's the the the "],["267.56","the overarching thing of the gospel is "],["271.1","the whole Bible the whole Bible from "],["272.96","Genesis to Revelation but there's a "],["275.419","pivotal point in the Bible and we we "],["279.74","call it the cross right the gospel of "],["283.31","Jesus Christ is centered around the "],["286.34","cross everything before the cross was "],["288.83","leading up to that point and everything "],["291.59","after that point looks back on it with "],["293.51","the expectation that he will come again "],["295.61","so the cross is at is is just absolutely "],["299.18","pivotal to the Great Commission that's "],["302.81","what we're to go teaching that's what "],["304.43","we're what we're commanded to do to go "],["306.65","and share the story of Jesus and the "],["309.59","power of the cross the the cross is a "],["313.13","radical message have you ever thought "],["314.84","about that how radical the message is I "],["317.889","reading in the book of Acts and I'm "],["320.419","paraphrasing here but basically the "],["322.639","disciples prayed a prayer and they they "],["324.44","basically said God the things that were "],["326.69","sharing the gospel that were sharing is "],["328.76","so fantastic so amazing that unless your "],["334.16","miracles your signs and wonders follow "],["336.8","us nobody's going to believe us because "],["341.33","the the message of the Cross isn't it "],["343.19","radical to think that God loves us and "],["347.24","all our sin and all of our nastiness and "],["350.33","he sent his son to die for us that's "],["353.45","ridiculous but it's fantastic and it's "],["357.65","beautiful and and so the message of the "],["361.31","Cross is central to what we do what we "],["366.26","share you see why is the cross so "],["369.32","important the cross is important because "],["372.56","it's transformational right we're all "],["376.25","here because we've been trance "],["377.84","we've been transformed right we've been "],["379.85","transformed into the image of Christ "],["382.669","we've closed we've closed ourselves with "],["385.43","righteousness and and so the cross is "],["389.93","transformational I just want to share a "],["391.7","couple stories that when we take this "],["394.01","message when we take the message of the "],["396.35","Cross and the the power of the "],["399.02","transformation of the cross it's a it's "],["401.6","a powerful thing to change lives even "],["403.82","the darkest lives even the dirty lives "],["406.31","even even the hurting lives the broken "],["409.039","lives the cross can transform them all "],["411.38","and so I

and then the cheaper wine after "],["650.35","the guests have had too much to drink "],["652.62","but you saved the best till now so what "],["658.63","can we learn from this account in "],["660.94","Scripture "],["662.74","well the bridegroom had already served "],["665.39","his best wine and this has run out and "],["669.43","the wine that Jesus created was better "],["672.83","than the best wine the bridegroom has "],["675.29","provided and also as a side note Jill "],["679.37","Jesus clearly had no problem with this "],["681.41","drinking wine if he did he

"],["722.93","part this is an important question for "],["728.12","us to consider and to answer for "],["731.03","ourselves why would we think that God "],["737.96","would ever withhold his best from

challenging few "],["84.29","years and there's some lessons I've "],["87.08","learned these past few years a few "],["90.11","months ago I resigned from the church I "],["92.3","planted 10 years ago I resigned there in "],["94.82","June and since that time God has been "],["97.43","teaching me many lessons maybe not "],["100.34","teaching me but re teaching me trying to "],["104.35","bring me back to understanding of things "],["107.6","that I've taught many times um but I'm a "],["110.6","kind of a slow learner I learned a sign "],["112.91","I was traveling as a young evangelist "],["115.25","there was a group of kids and there was "],["118.88","one kid at this event we were at and he "],["121.58","was hearing impaired and I wanted to get "],["124.25","in contact with him so the instructor "],["126.53","taught me how to you know do my name and "],["128.509","all that fun stuff and then when I did "],["130.459","that the kid was so excited he just went "],["132.08","you know 90 miles an hour but she had "],["134.09","prepared me for that and she taught me a "],["135.65","sign it has stuck with me all my life "],["137","you know I am a slow learner so I'm that "],["142.58","way with life too God teaches me things "],["145.069","and but usually he has to rehearse them "],["148.069","over and over again to me because I'm "],["151.67","not quick to pick them "],["153.58","Oh what I'm going to share with you "],["155.35","you're probably gonna say Steve I know "],["156.58","this or Steve I've heard this a thousand "],["159.28","times I can tell you I probably preached "],["161.59","these truths a thousand times but "],["165.43","there's something about the distance "],["167.8","between here to here so I'm gonna share "],["174.76","with you some things too often I have "],["178.78","been caught up in what's called the "],["180.87","performance trap while growing up my "],["184.72","father was not what you would call a "],["187.5","flattering man his way of telling was "],["191.26","proud of you was by saying nothing at "],["193.51","all by not criticizing and I'm not "],["198.76","blaming my dad for things because he was "],["201.459","raised that way and he raised us that "],["203.62","way but I was and it still and many "],["208.15","times and just a little kid who wants to "],["211.99","hear that I'm doing a good job and I "],["215.56","want to hear that people like me I I "],["218.2","want people to like me you might even "],["223.54","say I need people to like me this need "],["228.64","to be like though leads to some problems "],["231.43","it's led to more than one failure in my "],["234.04","life I often avoid conflict like the "],["238.269","plague because I believe that people "],["240.28","can't like me when I'm in conflict with "],["243.61","them and because I need to be liked "],["248.62","I avoid conflict do you know how hard it "],["252.28","is to lead your family a business or a "],["255.4","church with that mindset do you know how "],["257.859","hard it is to have a good relationship "],["260.26","with your wife if you constantly try to "],["262.72","avoid conflict now you think you're "],["265.69","making peace but in reality you're "],["269.11","creating a distance between one another "],["271.8","I've avoided conflict like the plague in "],["275.229","my church and that caused more problems "],["278.26","a second trap that I repeatedly walked "],["282.91","into was finding my identity in what I "],["286.06","did "],["287.74","anybody else that way you know as men "],["291.56","what's the first thing we ask each other "],["296.08","no usually they ask me how tall I am but "],["300.4","or how short you are I won't say "],["303.2","anything so many things I should not say "],["312.2","so I'll skip that "],["314.53","well we ask each other what do you do "],["317.72","and we get our identity from what we do "],["321.83","and I often have gotten my identity as a "],["325.7","pastor I believe God called me to be a "],["328.01","pastor but I didn't believe he was "],["330.44","pleased with me unless I was performing "],["333.02","well as a pastor I I didn't believe that "],["336.5","you know that God would watch over me "],["340.22","well if I did anything else or failed in "],["343.52","any way God would be displeased with me "],["345.89","and not want to hear my prayers or "],["348.26","converse with me I knew that he loved me "],["351.8","but I didn't know if he liked me or he "],["356.51","would ever want to hang out with me "],["358.22","I performed well enough if I read my "],["362.75","Bible enough if I prayed enough if I go "],["366.59","to church enough if I visit the sick "],["369.23","enough if I help the poor enough if I "],["372.08","give enough witnessed enough preached "],["374.87","enough studied enough seeing enough "],["377.45","Christian songs if my wife was godly and "],["381.5","nothing like kids behaved well enough if "],["383.66","my grades were high enough if I worked "],["386.27","hard enough if the church was growing "],["388.57","then maybe just maybe I would be pleased "],["393.44","with me the other side of this was how "],["399.83","long could I go without sinning now "],["403.82","every time I sinned I felt that whatever "],["405.98","relationship I might have with God was "],["408.08","gone and I would have to perform well "],["410.57","enough and long enough without sinning "],["413.21","before I could possibly have any kind of "],["416.24","relationship with God the Father or "],["418.16","Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit "],["421.64","how long would I have to live sinlessly "],["424.26","before God would hear my prayers again "],["427.82","somehow I usually applied this only the "],["430.35","big sins and not the little ones I don't "],["435.39","know if anybody else does that but do "],["438.57","you ever feel this way does any of this "],["441","resonate with you do you ever feel that "],["443.16","you must perform for God to love you you "],["448.56","must be good enough for God to be "],["451.32","pleased with you isn't this how most of "],["455.16","us were raised I mean we were raised "],["459.51","what with our parents if we did what our "],["462.63","parents wanted they were pleased and "],["465.75","happy with us and if we did they were "],["469.55","disappointed gosh is there any more "],["472.86","terrible words to hear as a kid son I'm "],["476.58","so disappointed in you I'd rather have "],["480.75","knife stuck in my eyeballs you know but "],["487.11","we're recently in school isn't it the "],["489","same way if the teacher likes you if you "],["492.54","did exactly what the teacher wanted and "],["495.12","the teacher was pleased with you if you "],["496.95","performed well so you would try and you "],["499.23","would work hard to perform well and if "],["502.08","you did then you got praised than you "],["504.12","were liked by the teacher and if not you "],["506.34","are like me and you knew the corner "],["507.96","better than you did the rest of your "],["509.46","classmates we learned this in our dating "],["518.419","we try to perform for our date so that "],["522.21","they will like us and we hope to fool "],["526.2","them long enough that they'll marry us "],["540.74","isn't this how we were raised isn't this "],["542.69","how we live and for me and I don't know "],["546.89","about for you but the words in John "],["548.54","14:15 "],["549.68","haunt me at times Jesus says if you love "],["552.62","me you'll do what Wow how many of you "],["558.26","did that this week okay how many of you "],["562.7","kept the commandment of being thankful "],["566.35","or is this Thanksgiving week I hope you "],["568.85","did that ones right how many of you then "],["571.16","after that obedience completely sinned "],["574.22","and did the sin of gluttony how many you "],["578.51","did it more than once and the same day "],["586.69","but God wants us to be thankful for who "],["590.36","we are and one of the things guys have "],["592.399","been teaching me being thankful for who "],["593.839","I am and the question though is who who "],["600.23","am i Who am I "],["603.41","a lot of us you know we go through this "],["606.44","list of Who am I and we we have this "],["609.56","question mark and we wonder who will "],["612.35","protect us who will provide for us who "],["614.029","or promote us what group will protect me "],["616.79","what group will provide for me who will "],["618.709","promote me so we identify with different "],["621.26","things we'll say I'm a Republican I'm a "],["624.26","Democrat

American or we "],["663.829","identify with our sin we say I'm a "],["667.87","alcoholic I'm a adulterer "],["671.92","I'm a porn addict I'm a liar but who "],["676.329","does God say that I am the Bible tells "],["683.23","us some truths and one of the truths a "],["687.43","set of troops that were summed up by "],["692.079","this group called royal servants our "],["693.73","daughters have gone on several trips "],["695.92","with them great mission Organization for "],["698.62","the cycling teenagers they take them on "],["701.589","this long trip there's two weeks of "],["703.42","training camp and then six weeks or more "],["706","in a foreign country and they do all "],["707.829","this work and service but the biggest "],["709.6","part of it is disciple the skids and who "],["713.019","they are in Christ and they have this "],["715.6","saying that our daughters brought home "],["717.97","and it's a made a huge impact on my life "],["720.88","and it's this and you can read it with "],["723.16","me please "],["723.82","it says I am deeply loved by God "],["726.49","completely forgiven fully pleasing "],["729.81","powerfully equipped totally accepted and "],["733.089","complete in Christ now we're just gonna "],["737.44","look at the first little part of this "],["739.149","but this is something I'm relearning all "],["741.94","the time again I'm a slow learner and I "],["746.649","need to hear these things over and over "],["748.75","I need to meditate on these truths over "],["751.269","and over and usually God has to bring me "],["754.779","through something it's usually something "],["759.61","I don't want to go through but he has to "],["763.12","bring me through something so that I "],["764.44","will rest in him and in these truths and "],["769.75","one of the things we have to and it's "],["771.01","all based on this truth that God gave us "],["773.17","up to the spirit of adoption God gave me "],["776.47","the spirit of adoption all of us were "],["779.74","spiritual orphans because we are born "],["782.56","separated from God that God adopts us "],["785.529","into his family and we are fathered by "],["788.86","God through Jesus Christ Romans tells us "],["792.85","for you did not receive the spirit of "],["795.13","slavery to fall back into fear but you "],["797.92","have received the spirit of adoption as "],["800.26","sons by whom we cry Abba "],["804.44","Father Romans also tells us that the "],["807.65","Spirit Himself bears witness that our "],["810.26","with our spirit that we are the children "],["813.05","of God and if children then heirs heirs "],["816.41","of God and fellow heirs with Christ "],["819.37","provided we suffer with him in order "],["822.05","that we may also be glorified in him "],["825.79","truth is if we have trusted Christ as "],["828.62","our Savior we are now God's children and "],["832.15","from that we learn these truths the "],["834.86","first truth is I am deeply loved by God "],["838.9","now of all these truths this is the "],["841.82","easiest one for me to to get I was saved "],["845.54","April 28 1910 and when I was 16 years "],["850.73","old and the sermon was just incredibly "],["854.15","powerful there was over 500 people in "],["856.22","the auditorium that night but I felt "],["857.84","like the guy was just rehearsing my life "],["859.46","and I won't get in all the details but "],["862.07","he was saying and God in His love sent "],["864.62","this and God in His love did this and it "],["866.6","was like yes he did that my parents "],["869.03","started going back to church my dad "],["870.59","started doing his Bible a friend invited "],["872.33","me Dada it was like everything he laid "],["874.7","out this whole big thing and he said "],["876.53","every time God was doing that he was "],["878.57","saying I love you and drawing him to "],["881.33","himself and so that night I said man God "],["884.18","loves me I'd heard it but I understood "],["887","that God loves me and I trusted Christ "],["889.1","as my savior that night and I realize "],["894.23","I'm deeply loved by God but the question "],["898.67","we have to ask ourself is are we living "],["901.58","an obligation based life for blessing or "],["905.36","are we living an affection based life "],["907.49","knowing we are loved by God an "],["911.72","obligation based life for blessing is a "],["914.39","life that says God I'm gonna do this and "],["916.73","then I know you will bless me God I will "],["921.23","go to church I will pray I will read my "],["923.48","Bible I'll give to the poor I'll do this "],["925.64","I'll do that and then I know that I'll "],["928.1","have your favor because I do these "],["929.87","things the affection based life of life "],["934.4","based on God's love is knowing you are "],["936.86","loved by God and because you "],["938.329","no you are loved man God you love me I "],["942.139","want I want to get in your word today "],["943.489","man God do you love me I want to talk to "],["946.1","you because I know you you want to talk "],["947.66","to me "],["948.79","God you you love that person because you "],["954.23","do I want to love them too and we know "],["959.449","this because look what it says in "],["960.86","Ephesians 2 4 and 5 says with God being "],["963.86","rich in mercy because of the great love "],["966.199","which with he loved us even when we were "],["969.829","dead in our trespasses made us alive "],["972.499","together with Christ by grace you have "],["975.949","been saved but God shows his love for us "],["979.399","and that why we were still sinners "],["982.179","Christ died for us "],["985.029","what an important truth it wasn't that "],["987.649","you know all of a sudden we did enough "],["989.689","goodness for God to all of a sudden love "],["992.029","us that God loved us while we were yet "],["995.72","sinners "],["997.029","yeah I've talked to people and you don't "],["999.439","invite them to church and they're like "],["1000.73","wow man I can't go to church because I "],["1002.649","did the roof would fall down on me "],["1004.389","because you know okay I got to take care "],["1006.999","of some things first it's maybe you "],["1009.069","don't when Christ died on the cross all "],["1013.72","your sins were in the and our mindset "],["1016.66","they were in the future right when "],["1018.879","Christ died he died for our past sins "],["1020.98","our present sins and all of our future "],["1023.169","sins God says I love you why were you at "],["1026.23","sinners I loved you you don't have to "],["1031.659","fix yourself up in order to be accepted "],["1034.299","by God that's the performance plan "],["1036.22","mindset it's saying if I do good enough "],["1038.919","God will love me God will bless me God "],["1041.38","will take care of me no God says why we "],["1043.809","were sinners Christ died for us "],["1046.089","he loved us where we are and He loves us "],["1051.21","still you see you and I cannot make "],["1055.299","ourselves

what we do nothing I can do will "],["1075.4","cause God to love me more or to love me "],["1080.14","less nothing "],["1082.89","that's an incredible thought that I have "],["1085.39","to repeat over

Ryan)","date":"2018-09-16","transcript":[["6.13","[Music] "],["21.9","good morning all right so uh pastor "],["27.34","asked me to preach last week because of "],["29.259","Robbie's wedding that's why he's not "],["32.23","here and I guess it went well because "],["34.059","when when Rob inadvertently butt-dialed "],["36.22","me during the reception it sounded like "],["39.579","everyone was having a pretty nice time "],["41.35","and I guess dinner was good and yes that "],["48.22","did happen anyway I of course I I said "],["51.79","yes and because you know I like to help "],["54.25","out it every now and then the question "],["55.98","when this comes up though is what do I "],["59.64","preach about as I said last time I "],["63.219","preached I can't really do expository "],["67.06","preaching like robbed you know it's "],["69.31","funny how ingrained that has become I "],["72.58","think in a lot of us now like when my "],["75.07","kids went away to college "],["76.45","well one went to college went up to live "],["79.149","with his grandparents to work in "],["80.8","Harrisburg so they left it nearly the "],["84.819","same time right when my my dog died and "],["87.429","so becoming in an empty nester is hard "],["90.55","enough when you're ready for it but when "],["92.289","it happens and you didn't know it was "],["94.239","gonna happen that's how you end up with "],["98.14","a puppy "],["98.679","anyway when my kids left they were "],["102.25","having trouble finding churches to "],["103.869","attend because they quote do it wrong "],["109.379","they don't work from the beginning of "],["111.849","one book until it's it's finished so "],["114.069","with that kind of pervasive mindset in "],["118.179","in the church I find I'm at a bit of a "],["121.27","disadvantage but then I thought well "],["122.83","well Rob seems to only preach like every "],["125.379","in two weeks Bert so so maybe I can do "],["129.399","some expository preaching by the way "],["131.2","that's a joke Rob and I rib on each "],["132.67","other so anyway I just won't do a a long "],["138.58","book I'll try expository but not a long "],["140.709","one because if I did like Isaiah or "],["142.269","something they'd be like fifty years and "],["144.269","probably not gonna be around that long "],["145.9","so if you'd like to turn in your copy of "],["149.11","the word to second John we're gonna give "],["152.32","this expository stuff "],["153.91","a shot now if you're doing that flip "],["159.61","technique you might miss it I've titled "],["163.81","this sermon love gone wrong which they "],["166","didn't put on that because I titled it "],["168.01","that this morning John you may know the "],["173.11","password not the pastor John the the "],["175.33","Apostle John is sometimes referred to as "],["177.46","the apostle of love because of his "],["181.15","extensive use of that word in the word "],["184","capital W and that word does seem to tie "],["188.05","together at least the first three of his "],["190.75","canonical letters John first John and "],["193.96","second John "],["194.89","but he might more accurately be called "],["197.44","the apostle of truth because that word "],["201.25","appears prevalently in all of his "],["204.13","letters or possibly he could be called "],["206.95","the apostle of obedience because that "],["209.92","word and forms of that word show up as "],["213.22","well but I'm not here to nitpick of "],["215.23","which or am i that might be exactly why "],["218.92","I'm here let's pray father god I just "],["222.24","again just want to want to praise your "],["224.8","name we look to you this morning and to "],["227.38","your word that in it we would find you

no other and the psalmist that were "],["204.95","or the song we're gonna be looking today "],["206.24","it's nice enough to elaborate on that "],["207.98","for us today we'll be reading in Psalm 8

"],["236.03","mindful of him and the son of man that "],["237.62","you should visit him for you have made "],["239.39","him a little lower than the angels and "],["241.13","you have crowned him with

"],["255.86","name in all the earth from the very "],["259.82","first verse it says how excellent is "],["262.73","your name in all the earth "],["263.75","and then the last verse says it as well "],["268","and is it really surprised when you "],["272.27","think about it that God's names exalted "],["274.79","above our own and that God is far "],["276.89","greater than us but why though see the "],["281.87","psalmist starts like that but then he's "],["284.21","nice enough to continue the thought and "],["285.59","explain the rest of it to us as to why "],["287.21","God is so great but he uses a strain "],["290.93","phrase like right out the gate in verse "],["293.539","2 it says out of the mouths of babes and "],["295.759","nursing infants you have ordained "],["297.229","strength because of your enemies that "],["298.729","you may silence the enemy and the "],["299.81","Avenger what what does that even mean "],["305.3","like I I don't think about strength when "],["309.38","I think of babies and out of the mouths "],["314","of bait do babies talk I mean outside of "],["317.449","doing the grunts and the cooing is that "],["319.039","Jackson has recently learned how to do "],["321.25","not really they but what do we see them "],["325.639","do in this verse they silenced the enemy "],["328.88","and the Avenger the voiceless are "],["332.78","silencing the boastful the root word "],["335.78","that they use for silencing is the same "],["337.82","word that we get sabbath from it is this "],["340.16","idea of completely cease so it's not "],["342.889","that these men are seeing these babies "],["344.78","going oh no they are silencing them "],["348.44","completely and we see this weakness "],["352.88","there and from weakness god overthrows "],["356.09","the strong and i mean we see this time "],["358.639","and time again it's a it's a common "],["360.56","theme in the bible with people like "],["362.36","Moses or Joshua or David or Gideon "],["367.12","there's a weakness against overwhelming "],["370.37","odds and you think there's no way that "],["374.21","this can happen nothing there's no way "],["376.01","they can do anything about this but then "],["378.349","they overcome because God made a way "],["381.52","there's also this element there of "],["383.75","dependence babies can't take care of "],["386.69","themselves especially nursing ones "],["389.12","they're very dependent on their mother "],["390.74","and they aren't going anywhere unless "],["393.349","you move them it reminds me of when Paul "],["397.009","talks about second Corinthians that "],["399.639","Christ's strength is made perfect in my "],["401.9","weakness and while I believe all this is "],["405.38","true I think to fully understand all "],["407.72","this we must consider the surrounding "],["409.22","two contexts as well because following "],["412.19","this section we see David articulate the "],["415.699","grandeur of astronomy and verse three he "],["419","says when I consider your heavens the "],["420.68","work of your fingers the moon and the "],["422.45","stars which you have ordained "],["426.009","David is looking at the beauty of how "],["428.179","amazing the creation is and how God "],["430.399","crafted it all and what I love the most "],["432.919","about this section is he doesn't refer "],["434.959","to God's whole hand here first to his "],["437.629","fingers as if God didn't even need the "],["440.449","rest of it to just do this and the stars "],["442.879","and everything are incredible how and he "],["445.399","bare leaves and it's created that's it "],["451.179","it's not even all of it to craft it's "],["454.459","just it's incredible "],["456.349","and I grew up in a rather urban area of "],["460.429","Jacksonville Florida when I was little "],["461.809","and there was light pollution all the "],["463.999","time didn't really even know what the "],["465.739","Stars truly looked like until I was much "],["468.11","older and Jacksonville you were lucky if "],["470.029","you got a helicopter or a plane could "],["473.119","make you think you saw a star but then "],["476.389","when we got here I saw stars that never "],["480.079","even knew existed they were incredible "],["482.449","but the problem was we still live right "],["484.249","next to the base so I still have light "],["485.989","pollution from that now if you go to my "],["488.36","granddad's house in the middle of "],["489.799","nowhere Georgia you literally have to go "],["492.349","to the middle of nowhere and turn left "],["493.429","and then you're there in a place where "],["495.919","you can shoot guns in your backyard and "],["497.479","no one cares the stars they are amazing "],["500.719","they're gorgeous "],["502.719","because there's nothing interfering with "],["505.099","them other than the pine trees which "],["506.869","smell really nice it's incredible and "],["511.369","light pollution has gotten to a lot of "],["512.809","Israel because they're developing a lot "],["514.55","of their cities but at

in the narrative of the gospel "],["196.57","well Jesus has already been resurrected "],["199.89","crucifixions happened he died came back "],["202.12","and he has shown himself to the "],["203.709","disciples twice once in the upper room "],["205.93","the other one with Thomas so obviously "],["209.95","after seeing Jesus twice alive "],["212.95","resurrected Peter goes back to Galilee "],["216.63","because that's the logical thing to do I "],["219.37","guess but he goes back to Galilee and "],["221.59","then he tells us other disciples let's "],["223.9","go fishing "],["224.47","so they go fishing and surprise surprise "],["226.69","they don't catch anything "],["228.15","so then Jesus appears on the shore and "],["231.15","provides a miracle they catch a whole "],["233.41","bunch of fish and then they meet him on "],["235.12","the shore for breakfast and that's where "],["236.59","this conversation takes place starting "],["240.31","in verse 15 so when they had eaten "],["243.1","breakfast Jesus son of Simon Peter sorry "],["246.4","jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of "],["248.65","John do you love me more than these and "],["251.98","he said to him yes Lord you know that I "],["253.69","love you and he said to him feed my "],["256.03","lambs he said to him again a second time "],["259.33","Simon son of Jonah do you love me he "],["262.57","said to him yes Lord you know that I "],["263.83","love you and he said to him tend my "],["265.66","sheep and he said to him the third time "],["267.669","Simon son of John do you love me and "],["270.49","Peter was grieved because he said to him "],["272.62","a third time do you love me and Peter "],["274.93","said don't Lord you know all things you "],["276.82","know that I love you jesus said to him "],["278.979","feed my sheep "],["280.21","I sure most assuredly I say to you that "],["282.97","when you were young you gird yourself "],["284.95","and walked where you wished but

think especially "],["305.35","to over here because you know this is "],["307.63","not the way that bros talk to each other "],["310.93","we don't talk about feelings "],["312.49","okay but Jesus is asking Peter straight "],["316.57","up do you love me and at first it seems "],["320.65","like Peters almost nonchalant about it "],["322.24","Peter do you love me yeah yeah yeah you "],["324.19","know what I love you man but Jesus keeps "],["327.52","pressing him on it do you love me do you "],["329.17","love me and Peter seems to get kind of "],["331.39","agitated by the end of it like you know "],["333.19","I love you why are you asking me this "],["334.63","you know all things but Jesus feels the "],["339.61","need to ask it to him three times but I "],["341.89","want to notice something the first "],["343.36","question is different than the other two "],["344.77","the first question is do you love me "],["347.95","more than these "],["348.73","what is that these he's talking about I "],["351.28","believe it's the fish that they just "],["353.65","caught and the fish that they had eaten "],["355.33","and during the breakfast because Peter "],["357.91","was a fisherman that's what he did that "],["359.71","was his trade before Jesus came and got "],["361.72","him he was fishing so Peter was going "],["365.62","back to what he knew how to do he was a "],["368.23","fisherman as long as he had a boat and a "],["370.45","net he had a guarantee of where a meal "],["373.3","was coming from and he had a livelihood "],["375.55","he could take care of

there was this element I think "],["388.03","of Peter like the part when he's with "],["390.88","Jesus is the best portion of his life I "],["393.28","feel like that was the best part of his "],["395.14","life walking around the Jesus going on "],["397.24","tour preaching teaching doing miracles "],["398.83","everywhere I think that was the best "],["400.93","part of his life and I think he wanted "],["403.27","it to go back to that he didn't want "],["406.09","what Jesus was going to reestablish now "],["407.83","as the church he wanted to go back to "],["409.27","them being

"],["419.7","comfortable and familiar so I'm gonna "],["422.14","ask you guys this question I'm gonna ask "],["423.64","you a couple of questions and I "],["424.75","once you guys would really think about "],["425.65","them and just do some soul-searching but "],["428.44","do you love comfort and familiarity more "],["433.3","than Jesus "],["436.05","do you love comfort and familiarity more "],["439.75","than Jesus so you've probably heard this "],["444.67","a few times but notice that Jesus asked "],["447.25","him three questions he asked him three "],["449.8","times and what other place do we see "],["453.31","three and Peter in the same sentence "],["456.82","the denials right Peter denying Jesus "],["459.37","three times but I want to make a note a "],["462.73","side note real quick because I feel like "],["464.68","a lot of times we like to rag on the "],["466.09","disciples for different reasons I mean "],["467.95","we like to rag on Thomas we literally "],["469.75","call him doubting Thomas you know that's "],["472.3","his title now but Peter we'd like to rag "],["474.73","on him for the denial like why would he "],["475.96","do that "],["476.41","well where Peter was when the denial "],["478.96","took place tells you a whole lot because "],["481.68","Jesus was taken to the high priests "],["483.88","house and there was a trial there that "],["485.41","wasn't even a legitimate trial but I was "],["487.51","it I was in Israel at the beginning of "],["489.16","summer I had to go for a school trip it "],["490.78","was a requirement which I suppose is a "],["492.58","pretty cool requirement but I went there "],["495.37","and I stood in the place that Simon "],["498.91","Peters supposedly denied Jesus there's a "],["501.28","Catholic Church there now because "],["502.33","Catholics just love planting churches "],["503.71","everywhere and I also was at the Sea of "],["506.86","Galilee where this conversation and "],["508.96","breakfast was supposedly "],["509.89","took took place now they kept the church "],["512.8","there but I stood in the courtyard where "],["515.11","it happened and it's right next to there "],["518.56","all the other disciples are gone they're "],["520.51","scattered they didn't even follow him "],["521.979","that far but Peter did he was that close "],["525.7","to Jesus he was following he was trying "],["527.26","to make sure the juice was okay but they "],["530.11","started pressing him hey were you with "],["531.37","Jesus and he gets scared no I wasn't "],["533.05","with Jesus it denies him three times so "],["536.62","yes it's a bad thing that he denied "],["538.66","Jesus but he was there at least but what "],["546.97","did he go back to doing we see him "],["548.86","follow Jesus to that point risking his "],["550.78","life basically to follow Jesus to that "],["552.61","point well what is he doing right before "],["554.23","this fishing he went back to fishing "],["558.37","and Peter had gone back to what he had "],["563.05","been doing before Jesus ever came on the "],["566.17","scene sorry but notice there were three "],["580.779","denials then there were three "],["583.6","appearances of Jesus this is the third "],["586.809","time that Peters seen Jesus alive and "],["589.059","there's also three questions I think "],["590.8","Peter is just really thick in the head "],["592.3","and this is how many times it took room "],["593.86","to actually understand things but my "],["596.439","question to you is do you actually love "],["598.329","Jesus and do your actions display do you "],["602.68","actually love Jesus "],["603.72","your actions display obedience flows "],["607.93","from love that is why actions are used "],["610.839","to measure the reality of Jesus and "],["612.339","individuals life that's why the fruit of "],["613.749","the spirits there are things that can be "],["615.189","observed that's how you know that he "],["617.8","Jesus is working in someone's life so "],["620.17","but do your act do you actually love "],["621.519","Jesus and do your actions show it last "],["626.05","observation well Peter always seemed to "],["631.12","assume a leadership position when it "],["633.97","came to disciples he was usually the "],["635.499","speaker for the group when the disciples "],["637.059","had a question and had to go to Jesus he "],["638.829","did it whenever there was a decision to "],["640.66","be made when Jesus wasn't around it was "],["642.069","usually Peter Peter was naturally a "],["644.709","leader to these disciples when he said "],["648.579","we should go back to Galilee beside "],["650.319","woman okay sounds good and he went back "],["651.819","to Galilee when you said hey we should "],["653.589","go fishing they went okay sounds good "],["655.48","and they started going fishing Peter had "],["659.11","this gifting he was a good leader but he "],["662.11","wasn't using it for the intended purpose "],["664.199","he was supposed to be the rock of the "],["666.759","church Christ is the cornerstone but "],["668.589","Peters the part of the foundation he was "],["671.019","supposed to be the start that's "],["671.92","literally what his name means he is "],["673.179","rocky he's the rock that the church is "],["676.87","built on but he wasn't using his gifts "],["680.17","for what they were supposed to be used "],["681.249","for he was leading them the wrong "],["682.779","direction and I think Jesus showed up "],["685.449","and he's telling him why are you leading "],["687.339","you know why are you misusing your gifts "],["689.319","though gabe's I gave you why are you "],["691.149","pointing them in the wrong "],["692.11","rection so I ask you this question what "],["697.209","gifts and skills do you have that you're "],["698.89","not using correctly because you've not "],["700.75","answered the calling that you have what "],["706.18","gifts and skills are you not using "],["708.399","correctly because you haven't answered "],["709.51","the call that you have now verse 18 I "],["716.23","will admit confuse me for a while and I "],["719.649","will also admit I'm not sure if I "],["722.529","interpreted it 100% correctly but I "],["725.14","think I have the principle correct but I "],["726.73","encourage you please study it for "],["728.44","yourself you find something else "],["729.94","different I'd love to hear about it "],["731.26","please talk to me about it but I believe "],["732.73","I have the principle correct the verse "],["734.589","reads most assuredly I say to you when "],["736.99","you were younger you girded yourself and "],["738.91","walked where you wished but when you "],["740.649","were old you will stretch out your hands "],["742.209","and another one will gird you and carry "],["744.1","you where you do not wish this he spoke "],["746.32","signifying by what death to glorify God "],["748.18","and when you spoken the same you said "],["749.98","follow me when you're young you dress "],["754.51","yourself and went wherever you please "],["756.69","but when you're old people will dress "],["759.04","you and take you where you don't want to "],["760.51","go what in my opinion Jesus is telling "],["770.89","Peter look man look you're just not "],["773.529","getting any younger okay "],["775.51","I'm sorry but do it now I'm calling you "],["778.779","to do this do it now you're young you "],["780.94","can do it you can run you can jump you "],["784","can swim you can fish go do it now while "],["789.519","you're healthy while you still have your "],["790.75","health while you're young go do it don't "],["793.57","sit around waiting until you're old and "],["795.19","then realize this too late there was a "],["800.589","slogan for a Rambo movie that came out "],["804.67","not the old ones "],["805.959","it's the newer one but the new ones "],["807.88","still not new it's old but the slogan "],["812.26","for it was die for something or live for "],["815.47","nothing and and the idea of it was you "],["820.089","know you can do something you should "],["821.74","probably do something and it you just "],["823.18","don't and you have it so what are you "],["824.98","going to do are you going "],["825.64","do this thing that's right and "],["827.85","potentially it go bad and you die but at "],["831.16","least you died for something or you're "],["832.66","going to ignore it and keep living for "],["835.21","nothing and I mean the verse literally "],["839.83","after says signified by what death he "],["841.63","would glorify God Peter didn't die a "],["845.26","natural death he was crucified the story "],["849.13","is that he usually was he was crucified "],["850.39","upside down because he didn't consider "],["851.68","himself worthy to be crucified in the "],["853.06","same way that's a tradition at least so "],["861.52","do it now if you have a calling in your "],["863.44","life you feel like God's calling you "],["864.67","somewhere do it now you're not getting "],["867.43","any younger answer your calling just do "],["871.66","it "],["873.42","what we're talking about callings I want "],["875.62","to tell you guys my personal experience "],["877.63","with this stuff I'm not going to claim "],["880.36","to be an authority on this I'm not "],["882.43","saying I'm perfect but I have "],["884.02","experienced what it feels like to feel "],["885.34","called so for me I grew up in church and "],["890.2","I really didn't care that much about God "],["893.19","I wasn't in a very good spot and then "],["896.5","when I was 16 years old it finally made "],["899.14","sense why my parents were Christians to "],["901.51","me I got into Scripture and I read "],["904.24","through it and I looked at it and I went "],["905.74","you know everything I've been looking "],["907.21","for is in God everything I wanted is in "],["912.91","God and so I pored through Scripture and "],["915.4","I loved it I loved studying Scripture "],["917.23","and it got to the point where I started "],["921.61","teaching people about it I started "],["923.08","preaching and I'd have conversations "],["924.97","about God everything like and people "],["927.49","were telling me you know you'd make a "],["928.48","good teacher you know you you should "],["931.69","preach have you ever thought about going "],["932.83","into ministry I'm like me no not going "],["936.73","into ministry I'm not doing that "],["940.03","it's ridiculous I'm not gonna go into "],["941.32","ministry so I started going to going to "],["943.9","college I was taking my classes and I "],["946.96","got to my second math class I was "],["949.06","studying to be a computer scientist "],["950.29","originally I got to my second math class "],["952.9","and I remember telling my mother mom if "],["955.72","I have to do this first of my life I'm "],["957.16","going to kill myself "],["959.1","I really don't like math but I was good "],["965.1","at it so so then I was trying to think I "],["967.32","was like okay what else can I do what "],["968.82","what else is there I was like well what "],["970.83","about like business what if I do "],["972.18","business maybe business is a good that's "],["973.68","a good major right yeah you can get good "],["975.66","jobs with that and I felt this voice in "],["977.82","the back of my head tell me I want you "],["980.37","to be a pastor and I went yeah okay what "],["984","about what about something like "],["985.05","communications that'd be kind of cool "],["986.4","you know working something like that "],["987.72","it's like that might be a good idea for "],["989.43","me I felt this voice in the back of my "],["991.62","head tell me I want you to be a pastor "],["994.43","okay

teaching I feel like I'm doing what "],["1062.15","I was born to do it comes more it feels "],["1066.08","like comes more natural to me than "],["1067.28","anything else I've ever done in my life "],["1069.7","everything else in my life has been a "],["1071.48","struggle but this felt like somebody "],["1074.9","that came naturally so here I am doing "],["1082.01","what I feel like I'm supposed to do and "],["1085.52","I'll be honest with you guys I felt this "],["1087.98","calling but I really didn't want to come "],["1090.26","home for this summer "],["1092.559","because I was supposed to be doing this "],["1095.049","internship and I knew that that was "],["1096.249","gonna put me right at the front of "],["1097.72","everybody when I preach I knew that was "],["1099.61","gonna put me in front of people and you "],["1100.96","know why that bothered me because people "],["1102.639","here know me not everybody knew me when "],["1106.539","I was growing up but a lot of people "],["1108.94","around here do and when they hear that "],["1111.22","Daniel Jones wants to be a pastor "],["1112.72","usually the first response I get is "],["1115.08","really that

"],["1125.35","molding him into what he's supposed to "],["1126.669","be and who realizes just how far he "],["1129.669","still has to go they don't think about "],["1131.919","the 20 year old kiddies but sitting in "],["1133.179","Bible classes for last two years they "],["1135.61","don't think about the kid who's had "],["1136.629","mentors who've poured into his life and "],["1138.7","taught him how to do ministry and shaped "],["1141.49","how he does things they don't think "],["1144.22","about the kids perspective is different "],["1145.69","the one that's not as selfish they don't "],["1149.619","think about that kid they think about "],["1151.36","the one that was 13 14 15 16 who "],["1156.159","deserved nothing but a good solid right "],["1159.07","hook to the jaw that punk deserved it "],["1163.21","and he never got it I have no idea how "],["1170.49","but that's what I deserved and I could "],["1172.899","use those as excuses and Peter could "],["1175.509","have used his denials and his excuses "],["1177.519","Jesus could come to him said Peter I "],["1178.72","want you to do this and he could have "],["1179.649","gone "],["1179.889","no I already screwed I blew it I can't "],["1181.72","do that I blew my chance I can't I can't "],["1185.74","do it and he could use this as an excuse "],["1188.58","but I don't use my faults as an excuse "],["1192.97","to not

"],["1202.84","be doing your calling because you that "],["1204.279","means you're not doing it out of your "],["1205.389","own strength I'm just doing it out of "],["1207.429","the strength that God

learned a little from "],["312.97","that my second wife I had a very in "],["316.87","cancer and and passed away after several "],["320.62","years dealing with that and so I've had "],["322.6","the

"],["380.53","years and looking back I can see "],["382.24","specific places where God really had his "],["384.6","fingerprints all over my life I didn't "],["388","realize it at the time but there were "],["389.35","places where choices were made or "],["391.87","situations came up and things happened "],["394.42","and and I can look back and clearly see "],["398.08","that he had a plan in all of it but at "],["400","the time I didn't really see it at all "],["405.51","one of the things that we all want to do "],["409.48","in life as believers is have those "],["412.3","mountaintop experiences "],["415.09","those times when we just know this is "],["418.15","all about God this is a great time this "],["420.52","is the place to be like standing on top "],["424.15","of the mountain but by the very nature "],["426.94","of having a mountain you've got to have "],["429.28","valleys around it and we can look at the "],["432.22","picture of Mount Rainier up there and we "],["434.44","have one mountain and where there's a "],["437.38","lot of valleys so the vast majority of "],["440.08","our life is live lived in the valley and "],["445.56","while we crave for the the mountaintops "],["448.18","and we want to get there we do that "],["452.74","sometimes to the exclusion of the joy "],["455.41","that we can find in the valley and we "],["458.5","start to look at valleys as being a "],["460.84","difficult place we put a label on it "],["463.389","like the desert we're living in the "],["465.52","desert so like a harsh place it's dry "],["469.24","it's hot it's rocky it's not where we "],["472.24","want to bathe we say I want to get out "],["474.4","of here I want to go to the mountain I "],["476.56","want to go somewhere better than this "],["482.28","but we need to think about what the "],["484.87","desert really is and challenge I want to "],["487.27","challenge our perspective of that we "],["490","open up the book of Exodus and and look "],["493.36","at what life in the desert was for the "],["496.32","Hebrews after they were drawn out of "],["500.34","Egypt they had bitter water made sweet "],["505.889","they were fed with manna and quail they "],["511.03","saw water come from the rock they saw "],["514.87","the protection of God with Moses arms "],["518.409","raised and the Amalekites defeated God "],["522.19","drew them to Mount Sinai on and married "],["527.41","his people was like a Jewish wedding "],["530.02","ceremony and we get to the very end of "],["534.7","the book of Exodus in chapter 40 and it "],["537.58","says in the cloud covering the tent of "],["539.68","meeting and the glory of the Lord filled "],["542.529","the tabernacle Moses could not enter the "],["545.05","tent of meeting because the cloud had "],["546.88","settled on it "],["548.11","and the glory of the Lord filled the "],["550.3","tabernacle in all the travels of the "],["553.39","Israelites "],["554.26","whenever the cloud lifted from above the "],["556.33","tabernacle they would set out but if the "],["558.37","cloud did not lift they would not set "],["560.589","out until the day it lifted so the cloud "],["564.31","of the Lord was over the tabernacle by "],["566.29","day and fire was in the cloud by night "],["568.98","in the sight of all the Israelites "],["572.14","during all their travels this is out in "],["575.86","the desert wouldn't we want to have been "],["578.829","there and even imagine what that would "],["584.829","have been like to walk along with them "],["587.86","and see all of these these things all "],["591.04","these different things happen so our "],["594.31","challenge is really to think of the "],["596.5","desert in a different way it's not a bad "],["598.54","place to be it can even be a great place "],["601.39","to be because it's a place where we're "],["604.209","most often experienced God where he'll "],["608.95","come and meet us he'll come into our "],["612.25","life and some really amazing ways I "],["615.329","think to Elijah I find the account of it "],["620.89","and first kings Elijah was running he'd "],["627.67","been out in the desert the Ravens "],["630.79","brought bread to him and meat and fed "],["633.339","him and then there was a situation where "],["635.89","he was running from Jezebel then and he "],["639.19","ends up under a broom tree in because "],["643","I'm done and God shows up and takes care "],["645.82","of them so when there's times when we're "],["648.7","at the end of ourselves out in the "],["652.089","desert hot tired thirsty hungry God will "],["658.12","show up then we say well so what about "],["662.92","me you can read all these stories in the "],["665.019","word I can sumter here and I can see "],["667.6","lots of instances of God showing up in "],["670.06","people's lives what about me I think one "],["673.39","of our challenges is that we want so "],["677.5","much to get ourselves out of the desert "],["679.39","and back to a mountain "],["682.31","we start to really fight and get there "],["686.18","on our own we started to ask a lot of "],["688.25","questions like what's God's will for my "],["690.44","life or what's the purpose in all this "],["692.87","why am I stuck in this struggle with "],["694.64","this sin that I can't overcome "],["696.62","why was my childhood so painful why did "],["699.709","my parents died when my child died why "],["702.92","is my life so difficult why can't I find "],["706.82","someone to marry why is my marriage so "],["709.31","difficult why can't I find a job why did "],["712.04","I lose my job why am I sick all these "],["715.13","questions but there's some other "],["719.69","questions that that we need to think "],["722.329","about that help us clear this out of our "],["725.3","mind when I ask you a question this "],["727.64","morning question that reframes things "],["730.88","and don't answer aloud we just think "],["732.92","about this "],["733.7","I must seriously consider it think back "],["737.6","to your most difficult moment over the "],["741.019","past few weeks maybe a time when you "],["744.29","were angry or really frustrated made "],["746.69","some really bad choice when you slip "],["749.39","back in some sin you were wrestling to "],["751.49","overcome when you're struggling with "],["756.14","with some addiction in that moment who "],["759.35","are you who would you say you are at "],["764.959","your very worst time how do you define "],["767.24","yourself who do you believe you are deep "],["770.959","down in your heart and then I want you "],["775.04","to think about how God our Father sees "],["779.66","you in that moment he sees you as his "],["784.55","precious child adopted into his family "],["789.94","clothed with the righteousness of Jesus "],["793.779","blameless and pure no longer a slave to "],["798.41","sin and heir of the promise living "],["804.38","eternally in that moment when you are "],["808.99","just a mess that moment when I am "],["812.14","totally melted down "],["815.209","he loves you with an infinite perfect "],["819.499","never-ending love he loves us with an "],["826.62","infinite perfect never-ending love at "],["829.079","our worst moment in life we need to wrap "],["833.43","our heart around that and treasure it up "],["837.199","because it really changes everything "],["840.899","about life in your bulletin insert "],["845.55","they've given you a whole bunch of "],["846.93","scripture verses we're not going through "],["848.459","all those right now but it's really "],["850.529","homework and I challenge you to take "],["853.98","those and read and study them and pray "],["856.649","over them and work your way through "],["858.93","there and read about who God says you "],["862.439","are so that you can begin to own that in "],["867.18","your life begin to see yourself in a way "],["872.639","that he sees you not in the way that the "],["875.579","evil one wants you to see yourself so "],["880.259","maybe if we can accept how he sees us as "],["882.959","his precious child "],["884.809","maybe our times in the desert would be "],["887.339","completely different completely "],["890.16","different maybe we'd be able to live at "],["895.379","a joyful expectation that he was going "],["897.99","to meet us there to be able to trust him "],["902.189","with all of our unanswered questions in "],["904.079","life be able to more fully accept his "],["907.35","love and rest in his love be able to "],["911.009","stop striving to perform for him and "],["914.699","meet his expectations so that somehow we "],["918.3","were acceptable but just know that we're "],["920.97","already accepted completely fully "],["923.97","there's nothing we have to do "],["928.129","maybe the cry of our heart would become "],["930.899","Jesus come close to me I want to know "],["933.269","you more I want to trust you more I want "],["937.829","to love you more be with me here in my "],["941.779","worst moment as never before just come "],["945.959","and be with me right here right now "],["950.3","so when we're able to reframe life in "],["956.7","that way when we see the calling that "],["961.17","God's put out for us calling to become "],["967.02","involved become involved in his story "],["974.87","in Ephesians chapter 2 it starts out as "],["978.33","for you you were dead in your "],["979.74","transgressions and sins in which he used "],["982.92","to live when he followed the ways of the "],["985.05","world and the ruler of the kingdom of "],["986.7","air and the spirit that is now at work "],["989.16","and those who are disobedient all of us "],["991.68","also lived among them at one time "],["994.279","gratifying the cravings of our flesh and "],["996.72","following his

made us alive with Christ even "],["1012.74","when we were dead in transgressions it "],["1015.11","is by grace you've been saved and God "],["1018.92","raised us up with Christ and seated us "],["1022.49","with him in the heavenly realms in "],["1025.189","Christ Jesus in order that in the coming "],["1027.41","ages he might show the incomparable "],["1030.11","riches of His grace

his love we're able to "],["1078.02","follow and step into his plan and "],["1082.07","we can go and make disciples and we can "],["1084.56","teach them to obey and we can fulfill "],["1086.63","the commandment in Matthew 28 and like "],["1091.52","in Hebrews chapter 12 we can run with "],["1094.19","perseverance the race marked out for us "],["1097.24","fixing your eyes on Jesus the Pioneer "],["1099.71","and perfecter of faith but along the way "],["1105.86","God's path is not an easy one to follow "],["1108.14","we must trust in his provision we must "],["1111.41","accept his love as

"],["1321.86","into my lap that I hadn't really thought "],["1324.95","about before a couple of months ago is "],["1328.96","God's story and what's the bookends of "],["1332.09","that story how does it start "],["1334.929","in how's it end we start out in Genesis "],["1340.97","and creation and don't get very deep "],["1344.09","into it and there's that fall into sin "],["1346.88","and "],["1349.64","and Adam and Eve in Genesis chapter 3 it "],["1352.07","says they realize they were naked and "],["1353.78","they hid from the Lord God they realized "],["1357.89","that they had fallen and they were "],["1359.87","ashamed and this thing of shame came "],["1364.52","into our lives and into creation and we "],["1368.12","live oftentimes with this feeling of "],["1371.99","shame over our life for the struggles "],["1373.94","that were wrestling with then we got to "],["1380.39","look at where God finishes his story "],["1384.64","because he gets rid of that shame and "],["1388.179","and closes it all up with a very nice "],["1392.419","ending in Revelation 22:20 1 says the "],["1396.86","grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's "],["1399.89","people amen so we need

"],["1486.35","scratching our head how does this happen "],["1488.98","but the reality is I believe that "],["1493.12","there's probably people sitting here "],["1495.83","some of you sitting here this morning "],["1498.19","that have not given your life to Jesus "],["1501.49","as Lord of your life there's things "],["1505.429","you're hanging on to things you're "],["1507.049","wanting to run

"],["1516.59","Lord and said Lord I want you to take "],["1520.159","control I was sitting in church in 1993 "],["1524.27","one morning in the springtime in a "],["1525.95","little country church in

the "],["31.84","first service veritable Adonis I also "],["39.72","hate to do this to everyone because I "],["42.64","know most people in the church are now "],["43.899","used to the way pastor Robb does it his "],["47.1","expository preaching going through an "],["49.3","entire book before moving on to "],["51.879","something else but I'm gonna I'm gonna "],["53.559","preach a topical message today hope you "],["56.35","forgive me I know I Greg you could have "],["59.11","preached on Jude or second or third John "],["61.6","you can cover them in one day just to "],["63.82","keep the tradition but maybe next time "],["67.09","I'll do that but today I wanted to to "],["69.82","preach on the second verse that I ever "],["72.22","memorized from the Bible the first of "],["74.86","course being John 3:16 i watch football "],["77.229","a lot I decided to preach a message on "],["81.49","this after one day a couple months ago I "],["84.25","was called on to do a devotional for one "],["86.409","of our elders meetings and just jokingly "],["88.39","I looked this verse up and I started to "],["92.53","look at the context around it and very "],["94.12","quickly I realized that this wasn't "],["96.34","going to be a joke this little verse "],["100.2","really packed a punch and and I "],["103.15","determined that the next time I preached "],["105.01","that's what I'm gonna do so this is what "],["107.68","I'm doing I've thought about this verse "],["109.409","while driving while studying I've "],["113.26","written several sermons now in the "],["114.88","shower but they're all lost down the "],["117.85","drain the paper gets wet it's been on my "],["121.39","mind for for really quite some time so "],["124","so this is where we're gonna go today "],["125.83","and as I thought about this as I prayed "],["129.489","for the Spirit's guidance and I probably "],["132.43","prayed more while writing this message "],["135.25","than any time in the past I kept "],["137.89","returning to this theme in my mind as I "],["139.78","as I wrote I would stop and I kept "],["143.59","coming back to this prayer in that "],["146.349","prayer is that I only write down what "],["148.9","God would have me write that I would not "],["151.629","read my own understanding into the "],["153.93","words but that God's understanding would "],["156.719","would come to me through the text and I "],["159.45","would like to pray for that again even "],["162.15","though it's already written down but as "],["164.489","we start here today and and as I pray I "],["167.01","ask each and every one of you that as I "],["169.95","say this prayer that you would also pray "],["172.65","and pray your own prayer that what you "],["176.099","hear today that the the words that come "],["180.989","out today would be the words that that "],["183.989","come from him and if there be anything "],["185.7","in this message that is from me that you "],["189.84","would just quickly forget those words "],["191.579","and they would not be a part of what "],["193.319","we're doing here today that they would "],["194.579","go unheeded "],["195.93","we don't want Craig's opinions today we "],["198.93","want God's truth so let's all just pray "],["201.359","father we thank you we thank you for "],["204.569","another opportunity to come together to "],["207.93","share in the fellowship of the believers "],["210.06","the fair and a fetish errand a "],["211.65","fellowship of this church but also Lord "],["213.93","to share in fellowship with you as you "],["217.56","speak your words to us as you speak to "],["219.87","us as you communicate to us just open "],["222.449","our ears open our hearts to what you "],["225.239","would say and father God just just speak "],["228.389","the words that come out of me "],["230.239","we thank you God for for the knowledge "],["233.159","that you are here with us and it's in "],["235.079","Jesus name that we pray amen "],["238.099","all right so let's look at the central "],["241.109","verse on which I would like to focus "],["243.239","today and that is John 11:35 try not to "],["247.019","read ahead but turn there in your Bibles "],["249.799","will read this together I'm gonna read "],["253.379","from the nasbe so hopefully your version "],["255.9","won't be too drastically different from "],["257.789","the one I'm reading so let's read John "],["260.19","11:35 Jesus wept all right so let's get "],["265.77","down to the nitty-gritty let's do a "],["267.78","little bit of exegesis Jesus wet "],["277.02","simple enough but it should raise a "],["280.09","question why did Jesus weep "],["283.83","why now well very good question I'm glad "],["288.1","you asked I think we need a little bit "],["289.33","of context so what we're gonna do is "],["291.19","we're gonna read the first 46 verses "],["293.14","then okay so though we're gonna get away "],["296.17","with a little we're gonna do 46 verses "],["298.17","something Rob has never done so let's go "],["300.79","a log now a certain man was sick Lazarus "],["306.82","of Bethany the village of Mary and her "],["308.41","sister Martha "],["309.31","it was the Mary who anointed the Lord "],["310.93","with ointment and wiped his feet with "],["312.58","her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick "],["314.65","now interesting thing in John that story "],["316.9","isn't told until the next chapter and "],["319.24","her like it's that lady what lady the "],["321.19","one I'm gonna tell you about later okay "],["322.72","so anyway I just think that's funny so "],["325.72","the sisters sent word to him saying Lord "],["328","behold he whom you love is sick but when "],["330.61","Jesus heard this he said this sickness "],["332.59","is not to ended death but for the glory "],["334.42","of God so that the Son of man may be "],["337.03","glorified by it now Jesus loved Martha "],["339.82","and her sister and Lazarus so when he "],["342.37","heard that he was sick he then stayed "],["345.58","two days longer in the place where he "],["347.53","was then after this he said to the "],["350.169","disciples let us go to Judea again "],["353.46","previous chapter by the way they were "],["355.84","just in Judea where Jesus basically said "],["358.9","I'm God which they were going to stone "],["361.57","him for blasphemy which causes the "],["364.87","disciples to say something the disciples "],["368.86","said to him rabbi the Jews were just now "],["372.15","seeking to stone you and are you going "],["375.04","there again "],["375.82","jesus answered are there not twelve "],["377.5","hours in the day if anyone walks in the "],["380.2","day he does not stumble because he sees "],["382.27","the light of this world but if anyone "],["384.64","walks in the night he stumbles because "],["386.5","the light is not in him "],["387.91","that's comforting this he said and after "],["391.51","this he said and then after that he said "],["393.91","to them our friend Lazarus has fallen "],["395.77","asleep but I go so that I may awaken him "],["398.98","out of his sleep the disciples then said "],["401.47","to him lord if he has fallen asleep he "],["403.81","will recover now Jesus had spoken of his "],["406.51","death but they thought he was speak "],["408.529","king of literal sleep repeat that like "],["411.679","so Jesus then said to them plainly "],["413.569","Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your "],["418.099","sakes that I was not there so that you "],["420.259","may believe but let us go to him "],["422.449","therefore Thomas who was called didymus "],["424.699","the twin said to his fellow disciples "],["426.769","let us also go so that we may die with "],["429.709","him now when we think of Thomas we "],["431.419","usually think of doubting Thomas okay "],["433.639","but Thomas also shows another side here "],["435.799","he's pretty brave oh we're gonna go back "],["438.769","there the place that they want to kill "],["440.539","him "],["440.839","great well guys let's go die that's "],["447.139","actually not a bad attitude so when "],["450.169","Jesus came he found that he had already "],["451.969","been in the tomb four days we'll come "],["453.859","back to that now Bethany was near "],["455.929","Jerusalem about two miles off and many "],["458.029","of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary "],["459.559","to console them concerning their brother "],["463.419","Martha therefore when she heard that "],["465.559","Jesus was coming went to meet him but "],["468.079","Mary stayed at the house we'll come back "],["469.849","to that Martha then said to Jesus Lord "],["472.219","if you had been here my brother would "],["474.709","not have died even now I know that "],["477.709","whatever you ask of God God will give "],["479.569","you jesus said to her your brother will "],["481.729","rise again Martha said to him I know "],["484.549","that he will rise again in the "],["485.929","resurrection on the last day but jesus "],["488.119","said to her I am the resurrection and "],["490.399","the life he who believes in Me will live "],["493.429","forever "],["493.969","there were excuse me will live even if "],["496.249","he dies and everyone who lives and "],["498.199","believes in Me will never die do you "],["500.749","believe this she said to him yes Lord I "],["504.139","have believed that you were the Christ "],["505.939","the Son of God even he who comes into "],["508.639","the world when she had said this she "],["511.219","went away and called Mary her sister "],["513.199","saying secretly will come to that the "],["515.629","teacher is here and is calling for you "],["517.579","and when she heard it she got up quickly "],["519.889","and was coming to him that's Mary now "],["522.229","Jesus had not yet come into the village "],["523.849","interesting but was still in the place "],["525.62","where Martha met him then the Jews who "],["528.379","were with her in the house and consoling "],["530.179","her when they saw that Mary got up "],["531.74","quickly and went out they followed her "],["533.449","supposing that she was going to the tomb "],["535.519","to weep there Jewish custom when someone "],["538.069","dies first day is of hard morning second "],["540.679","day little less third day "],["542.22","little s and then you finish the rest of "],["543.81","the week out morning people would "],["545.4","actually come and do that with you so "],["546.99","that's who these people are therefore "],["550.62","when Mary came where Jesus was she saw "],["552.96","him and fell at his feet she tends to be "],["555.51","there saying to him lord if you had been "],["557.88","here my brother would not have died "],["559.86","exact same words verbatim as her sister "],["563.01","said it sounds a little rehearsed when "],["567.6","Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the "],["569.55","Jews who came with her also weeping he "],["572.07","was deeply moved in spirit and was "],["573.84","troubled and said where have you laid "],["576.15","him they said to him Lord come and see "],["579.23","key verse jesus wept so the Jews were "],["583.41","saying see how he loved him but some of "],["586.47","them said could not this man who opened "],["588.66","the eyes of the blind have kept this man "],["590.91","also from dying "],["596.84","so Jesus again began being deeply moved "],["601.71","within came to the tomb now it was a "],["604.29","cave and a stone was lying against "],["606.66","itself familiar jesus said removed the "],["608.79","stone Martha the sister of the sea said "],["611.61","to him Lord by this time there will be a "],["613.77","stench free has been dead for days said "],["617.55","we come back to it we'll come back to it "],["618.87","again "],["620.03","jesus said to her did I not say to you "],["622.62","that if you believe you will see the "],["624.69","glory of God so they removed the stone "],["628.05","then Jesus raised his eyes and said "],["629.73","father I thank you that you have heard "],["631.14","me I knew that you always hear me but "],["633.84","because of the people standing around me "],["635.52","key I said it so that they may believe "],["638.25","that you sent me when he had said these "],["641.79","things he cried out with a loud voice "],["643.26","Lazarus come forth the man who had died "],["648.24","came forth bound hand and foot with "],["650.37","rappings and his face was wrapped around "],["652.2","with a cloth jesus said to them unbind "],["654.6","him and let him go therefore many of the "],["659.01","Jews who came to Mary and saw what he "],["661.8","had done believed in him but some of "],["663.84","them went to the Pharisees and told them "],["665.82","the things which Jesus had done "],["667.71","immediately went to his enemies "],["673.41","do a little wordplay here the logical "],["682.5","answer to the question why did Jesus "],["686.13","weep and probably the one that first "],["687.93","pops to mind is that Jesus weeps because "],["690.72","his friend is dead the Jews that were "],["694.83","accompanying Mary they say this in verse "],["696.63","36 see how he Jesus loved him Lazarus "],["700.28","they would be an agreement but I noticed "],["703.8","something interesting as I was studying "],["705.03","this in verse 33 the text says that "],["710.22","Jesus saw Mary and the Jews weeping now "],["715.11","the Greek word in both of these cases is "],["717.27","the word clio a I like an O word Isle "],["723.18","clio to weep for to be wail to mourn "],["729.02","this is a loud crying out these are "],["735.6","tears clearly shed because Lazarus has "],["739.89","died but the word in verse 35 is "],["745.89","different the word is decree o to shed "],["753.12","tears to weep this is the only place in "],["758.4","the entire New Testament that this word "],["760.38","is used all the other times it speaks of "],["763.35","weeping or wailing it's another word "],["765.9","this is the only time that it's used it "],["768.63","simply means to shed tears or weep "],["772.56","without necessarily the connotation of "],["775.11","mourning and I'm gonna admit that for "],["776.82","years I got this wrong I pictured a "],["781.49","bawling a year just a complete "],["784.83","unleashing but that's not accurate "],["789.62","probably the most accurate version is "],["794.49","the International Standard Version that "],["796.14","translates this Jesus burst into tears "],["804.27","the best from the original Greek now "],["805.62","what we see is a sudden powerful "],["809.09","outburst of tears it's kind of like I "],["812.43","remember one year one spring when I was "],["816.18","a youngster my brother and I got into an "],["819.24","argument I was about 8 years old he was "],["822.03","probably 10 and there was a ditch behind "],["825.15","our trailer in our lovely trailer park "],["827.76","that was usually filled with water and "],["829.56","in this water we had these little things "],["831.63","we call them seahorses he'd splashing "],["833.31","they'd go underwater and come back turns "],["835.05","out they were mosquito larvae book we "],["836.37","didn't know so anyway um but in this "],["842.16","ditch also one day we saw this frog "],["846.5","laying eggs and carrying a much smaller "],["849.18","frog on its back and my brother who "],["852.66","again was the older of the two he said "],["855.24","oh look it's carrying its baby I scoffed "],["860.52","and said that's not its baby you big "],["862.86","dummy they're mating and he's all no no "],["868.02","it's his baby and I'm like dude it's "],["869.7","laying thousands of eggs what it just "],["871.62","picks one to carry around for a few "],["874.71","months no they're mating "],["876.24","so we're arguing and he's considering "],["878.76","beating me up but we going to ask my dad "],["881","and my dad determined this was a good "],["883.41","time to sit Frank down and tell him "],["885.03","about the birds and the beasts because "],["888.5","okay so anyway dad's telling Frank and "],["893.49","while he's doing so I sneak behind the "],["895.26","couch that my father's sitting on and "],["897.93","right when he gets to you know the good "],["899.64","baby part I pop up behind the couch you "],["902.76","go mama "],["903.81","okay now now my brother knows laughing "],["909.69","at that moment is not a good idea so he "],["916.74","holds it back which of course makes the "],["920.7","spectacle replay over and over in his "],["923.37","mind which makes it funnier if what you "],["925.5","ever been in that situation is "],["926.76","completely inappropriate to laugh and so "],["929.25","instantly it's a thousand times funnier "],["931.5","until suddenly you go ahh "],["933.54","and that it's one outbursts and then "],["935.49","like okay "],["937.62","and I crawled away as he got the worst "],["939.779","beating of his life "],["941.54","we hope I actually just found out about "],["944.1","three years ago we were reminiscing "],["945.33","about that and my dad said I never knew "],["947.52","you did that Greg "],["949.68","I almost got my brother killed and he "],["951.93","didn't know and so now he feels really "],["954.39","bad "],["955.98","but anyway so why that story well Jesus "],["962.31","is outburst of weeping is kind of like "],["965.88","that laughs that my brother had where "],["968.91","it's been in there for so long and it's "],["971.85","just storing up and the knowledge of "],["974.43","what happened that this person doesn't "],["976.32","know and it just it just had to burst "],["977.97","out and so Jesus begins to weep like "],["983.7","that now this word denotes a quieter "],["987.27","weeping then the weeping of mary and the "],["991.11","weeping of the others but it's one that "],["993.66","could no longer be contained and so the "],["997.89","again that brings us back to the "],["999.69","question why weep and why the different "],["1002.93","word I think John uses a different word "],["1006.68","because he's delineating the difference "],["1008.54","between Jesus's tears and the other's "],["1010.94","tears it's a there's a different reason "],["1014.05","for the tears oh by the way the actual "],["1017.92","word that's used as a form of the "],["1020.39","daiquiri oh that means to burst into "],["1022.31","tears so why does Jesus weep well I "],["1028.699","submit that it is because of who he is "],["1034.959","we have to remember that Jesus was a "],["1037.4","human he gets hungry he thirsts he grows "],["1043.67","weary he needs to rest his body takes up "],["1047.089","an actual physical space he has a mind "],["1049.49","he has that physical body and he has a "],["1052.19","human soul yes to be fully 100% human he "],["1057.92","had to have a soul but he's also God "],["1061.84","he's eternal he was he is and he always "],["1065.87","will be he's omniscient he's omnipotent "],["1068.15","and he's on the benevolent "],["1071.47","his divine spirit is omnipresent but he "],["1075.14","lemons that to himself by himself he "],["1078.35","knows the past "],["1079.55","he knows the present he knows the future "],["1082.13","he somehow doesn't know how he's gonna "],["1083.39","return and I admit that I've never fully "],["1085.13","understood that but that's a different "],["1086.51","day so let that go I'm not gonna go in a "],["1088.7","tangent point is he is God so does Jesus "],["1093.92","weep because Lazarus is dead "],["1098.17","sure he does but he knows that he's "],["1102.23","gonna resurrect Lazarus "],["1105.37","so does he weep for Lazarus well yes but "],["1109.43","no and no because he's gonna live but "],["1114.77","yes because he's gonna live here we'll "],["1121.7","come back to that but now let's look at "],["1124.58","the rest of the characters because I "],["1126.5","think it's gonna help us understand a "],["1128.57","little bit more of why he weeps when we "],["1131.03","look at everyone who's there first we "],["1133.55","have the guy we just mentioned we've got "],["1138.55","Lazarus Lazarus sort of acts as Jesus's "],["1144.44","object a lesson for any of the kids that "],["1146.66","have ever gone to children's church you "],["1147.98","know what an object's lesson is Jesus "],["1150.29","waits for Lazarus to die I think that's "],["1152.27","an interesting point he waits for him to "],["1154.34","die we're gonna come back to that I'll "],["1157.22","say that a lot because he doesn't just "],["1159.26","wait until he dies there's some extra "],["1166.22","time but I want to get ahead of myself "],["1169.91","so basically he does this so that the "],["1173.27","disciples can learn a truth verses 14 "],["1175.28","and 15 say so Jesus then said to them "],["1177.74","plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for "],["1181.64","your sake I'm glad that he's dead for "],["1184.31","your sakes that I was not their words "],["1186.38","with Mary and Martha so that you may "],["1188.15","believe but let us go to him Lazarus "],["1190.49","becomes a type a quote person or thing "],["1195.83","believed to foreshadow another Martha's "],["1200.33","words are going to point to this so "],["1201.98","we'll discuss it when we talk about "],["1203.18","Martha "],["1204.39","other than that we can't really say much "],["1205.62","about Lazarus he's the object lesson at "],["1208.5","least we can't say much now so let's "],["1210.27","move to the next character characters we "],["1214.95","have two disciples now they're gonna "],["1216.36","play a very small role here but they're "],["1219.78","very important they are essentially "],["1222.09","Jesus's audience for this object lesson "],["1225.33","sight the same verses verses 1415 this "],["1229.35","is really their sole purpose here to "],["1231.66","witness what happens and to remember it "],["1234.78","later don't unfortunately they don't "],["1236.19","really get it and remember it until "],["1237.78","Jesus is already dead and in his glory "],["1239.49","but at least they they eventually get it "],["1243.92","but because of that we're essentially "],["1246.27","done with them here for now but I submit "],["1249.72","this to you to ruminate to chew on for "],["1252.78","the rest of my message Jesus weeps for "],["1258.3","them next we have Martha who comes out "],["1268.47","to greet Jesus what jump ahead there but "],["1271.83","we'll leave it this is the same Martha "],["1275.37","that most people probably remember for "],["1277.2","her failings in Luke chapter 10 verses "],["1279.69","40 and 41 but Martha was distracted with "],["1283.2","all her preparations as she came up to "],["1285.09","him and said Lord do you not care that "],["1287.25","my sister has left me to do all the "],["1288.99","serving alone then tell her to help me "],["1291.21","but the Lord answered and said to her "],["1293.22","Martha Martha you are worried and "],["1295.83","bothered about so many things while her "],["1298.02","sister sat there it sees his feet and "],["1299.55","learned so he kind of gets rebuked same "],["1301.59","girl but we have here is a more mature "],["1305.78","Martha a more mature believer she shows "],["1310.08","a lack of understanding in her greeting "],["1312.03","a verse 21 when she says Lord if you had "],["1316.23","been here my brother would not have died "],["1317.79","but then she doesn't have the advantage "],["1321.42","that we have of knowing of the Ascension "],["1323.31","of the crucifixion being in the tomb and "],["1325.41","then come back that hasn't happened yet "],["1327.18","so she doesn't know that what she does "],["1330.03","is in verse 22 she shows her maturity "],["1332.22","when she says even now I know that "],["1334.98","whatever you ask of God God will give "],["1337.47","you now the "],["1338.22","a little background on this that we kind "],["1340.59","of have to understand to understand why "],["1342.39","that statement by Martha was so "],["1344.549","important when Jesus gets to the tomb "],["1347.94","and orders the stone to be rolled away "],["1350.039","it's Martha who says in verse 39 Lord "],["1354.03","by this time there will be a stench for "],["1356.49","he has been dead for days four days is "],["1361.22","very very significant because there was "],["1364.409","a belief among the Jews that the soul "],["1366.929","would remain near the body for three "],["1369.75","days after death in the hope of "],["1371.88","returning to it if that idea was in the "],["1375.24","minds of the Jews that were gathered "],["1377.1","there in the minds of the people there "],["1378.659","four days would mean that all hope for "],["1382.049","the soul returning to the body was gone "],["1384.69","Lazarus was irrevocably dead so Jesus "],["1390.51","waits for that moment and to show "],["1396.059","Martha's maturity she says in verse 22 I "],["1398.549","know not I think not I believe I know "],["1401.33","that whatever you ask of God God will "],["1404.34","give it to you Martha is a woman of "],["1406.559","faith she understands even before the "],["1409.409","object lesson that's about to come even "],["1411.33","be before Jesus rises from the grave "],["1414.15","that the dead will rise on the last day "],["1416.309","and Jesus weeps for her we next have her "],["1423.51","sister Mary she comes out to meet Jesus "],["1426.179","where Martha met him no Mary greets "],["1428.909","Jesus with the exact same words of her "],["1431.52","sister Lord if you had been here my "],["1434.85","brother would not have died remember "],["1436.559","jesus said to his disciples I'm glad I "],["1438.059","was not there so I could teach you "],["1440.28","Echo's the same thing now this is all we "],["1443.7","hear of Mary hear this echo of her "],["1448.14","sisters words knowing that in Jesus "],["1452.58","there is life but that's as far as she "],["1456.15","goes she seems to have not moved much "],["1460.52","beyond that woman who sat at Jesus's "],["1463.71","feet while he taught and her sister "],["1465.96","served the other guests she loves Jesus "],["1470.03","she knows he has "],["1472.169","power and Jesus weeps for her next we "],["1480.96","have the morning Jews with au those who "],["1486.179","have come out to support the family as "],["1488.009","they mourn their loss by morning with "],["1490.98","them these people understand the "],["1494.309","importance of the fellowship and of the "],["1496.289","compassion that helps others get through "],["1499.559","this world and get through tough times "],["1501.33","when Mary goes out they follow her they "],["1504.57","don't quite understand where she's going "],["1507.389","but when she leads them to Jesus and she "],["1511.049","does lead them to Jesus they don't quite "],["1513.48","understand what it is that lies before "],["1515.549","them some just see his love verse 36 oh "],["1518.549","how he loved him but some of them "],["1521.369","immediately began to question him and "],["1523.499","his purposes saying essentially in verse "],["1525.779","37 what he can give blind people's sight "],["1528.539","but he couldn't have stopped Lazarus "],["1530.129","from dying you say you loved him well "],["1535.649","why do you let him die this is similar "],["1538.889","to a question here today if God is so "],["1541.379","good why doesn't he put an end to all "],["1542.879","the evil in the world "],["1544.08","does anyone fully understand what you're "],["1545.94","saying when you say that that's a

would decide to "],["1581.789","follow Jesus after they see the object "],["1584.159","lesson that he has verse 45 but some "],["1586.619","simply decide to deny him even going so "],["1589.619","far as to report him to the Pharisees "],["1592.379","and Jesus weeps for every one of them "],["1598.789","and they enter "],["1602.11","to the final group the Pharisees "],["1608.19","hold on Gregg hold on the Pharisees "],["1611.38","aren't even really there exactly they "],["1615.94","didn't even come out if we keep reading "],["1618.67","in John we discovered that the Pharisees "],["1620.799","use this miracle as a rationale for "],["1623.549","murdering Jesus and for murdering "],["1626.29","Lazarus because quote if we the "],["1630.82","Sanhedrin let him go on like this "],["1632.92","performing miraculous signs everyone "],["1635.77","will believe in him yeah cuz he's who he "],["1639.79","said he is because he's worthy of being "],["1643.12","believed in and then

"],["1668.049","little knowledge oh they have the "],["1670.33","knowledge of the Old Testament with very "],["1673.03","little knowledge of him they simply "],["1674.86","chose the hard in their

that's probably one at "],["36.53","the very top and a good understanding of "],["40.04","the parable that we look at this morning "],["41.96","would help you when you study all of the "],["44.3","other parables the term parable comes "],["47.96","from two words para beside and Ballal to "],["52.1","throw down "],["52.879","so it's something placed beside "],["55.04","something else for contrast or "],["56.989","comparison so all through the New "],["59.72","Testament Jesus taught in parables and "],["62.75","it was kind of interesting because "],["64.129","sometimes they were designed to help "],["65.99","people understand and other times they "],["68.72","were designed to help people not "],["70.689","understand in the Old Testament we run "],["74.18","into Proverbs same concept a contrast in "],["77.99","comparison a short pithy saying that "],["80.78","gives you insight to some incredible "],["83.72","things in terms of how God works how the "],["85.549","kingdom works how the father's mind "],["88.61","works so we're in Luke chapter 15 this "],["94.34","morning Luke 15 we'll have it up in the "],["97.82","screen but if you have your Bibles then "],["99.409","that's good too sometimes it's called "],["106.52","the the parable of the prodigal the "],["111.229","parable of the legalistic son and "],["114.17","perhaps maybe the better one would be "],["116.33","the parable of the loving father two "],["121.159","groups of value that we'll read in the "],["123.14","text two things of value two sons of "],["126.38","value three things that are lost three "],["129.89","things that are found and three parties "],["132.59","that are thrown we have three sons in "],["136.819","the text a sinning son a self-righteous "],["142.01","son and a saving son so let's come into "],["147.86","the text and we'll spend a little time "],["149.989","reading about it and then a few thoughts "],["151.61","with respect to it then drew near onto "],["156.769","him "],["157.73","in the phrase literally means that they "],["159.53","kept coming and kept coming and kept "],["161.15","coming that's the impact of Jesus "],["164.69","ministry folks wanted to come and here's "],["168.11","the two groups that came and gathered "],["169.849","around him on to him all the publicans "],["173.59","all the tax farmers all the people that "],["177.709","bought their position and were in "],["180.129","franchised by the Roman government that "],["183.019","to collect the money so you understand "],["185.36","what happens is they paid a certain fee "],["187.159","for that job and then they were allowed "],["190.01","to tax to the degree that they could at "],["194.75","least get away with and they heavily "],["197.299","taxed people mentioned in the other "],["200.209","service we you don't do that here I know "],["202.879","that but in in New Brunswick we "],["204.709","complained about our government and our "],["208.549","taxation and our sales tax and we come "],["212.959","down here and you have find out what's "],["214.7","your sales tax five percent or seven "],["217.519","percent "],["218","oh six percent oh that's heavy ours is "],["221.06","13 so we'll complain a little bit about "],["225.98","your system but more about ours they "],["230.419","weren't popular people nobody liked "],["234.59","these tax farmers publicans and sinners "],["240.28","that word literally means to miss the "],["242.93","mark or to come short all have sinned "],["246.23","and come short of the glory of God this "],["253.25","other group didn't like short people I "],["256.51","like short people I I think there's some "],["259.76","of the nicest people but they've come "],["263.12","short what's their goal they want to "],["267.68","hear and it's more than just physically "],["271.4","hearing they want to hear and understand "],["274.37","which literally means this that you you "],["276.65","have to pay attention you have to try to "],["279.229","grasp what he's saying and what he's "],["280.82","trying to communicate and these folks "],["283.22","are coming for that purpose and then you "],["287.12","have the Pharisees that's "],["290.449","interesting group aren't they they're "],["292.49","the separatists they're the they're the "],["295.879","folks that can can cut and slice and "],["299.24","hurt you and cause pain and they "],["301.759","followed the Lord through all of his "],["303.08","ministry or sometimes hard on the "],["306.11","Pharisees Jesus commended them on a "],["308.719","couple of occasions so he said you're "],["310.999","doing really good in some areas you're "],["313.279","meticulous about your tithing you tithe "],["315.409","your mint and your column and so on the "],["318.68","problem is you're missing the greater "],["320.24","things of the law in the impact of your "],["324.409","heart and other people and then of "],["326.9","course scribes people that are very "],["329.96","meticulous with the Scriptures jot and "],["332.96","tiddle evaluating everything writing it "],["336.8","all down recording it these are the "],["340.039","lawyers number of years ago I was in a "],["344.3","law office in in Woodstock and we were "],["348.02","buying a piece of property and the "],["349.569","lawyer had done the work for me and and "],["352.159","he had in his on his desk in his for ya "],["355.849","a book about lawyers you know little "],["360.05","jokes little and one of them was what do "],["364.61","you call a thousand lawyers at the "],["365.99","bottom of the sea oh yeah you read the "],["369.77","book - yeah good start yeah lawyers in "],["381.529","the midst of doing the transaction he "],["385.189","was arrested for embezzlement "],["387.729","and I had my property in limbo and I "],["394.189","went in to get my deed the next day and "],["396.909","someone had taken over his office and "],["399.469","was managing his accounts and and he "],["402.229","said well I'm sorry really feel bad for "],["404.389","you a nice lawyer and he said I'll help "],["407.539","you I'll bring yours to the top of the "],["409.819","pile and he put it through and then I "],["414.469","went to my bank similar crowd here "],["420.84","and they wouldn't accept it they said no "],["423","no no we can't trust the work and we had "],["425.28","to start all over again and spend the "],["427.44","money get off on a sidetrack tonight "],["431.06","Pharisees and the scribes and they "],["433.199","murmured saying this man receiveth "],["436.229","sinners unto himself and he eats with "],["440.16","them he sits down and fellowships with "],["442.08","them you know how hard it is to sit in "],["447.11","any environment have a meal together if "],["450.12","you don't get along you know that that's "],["452.97","why we have the lord's table isn't it "],["454.53","that's one of the reasons why we "],["455.49","practice communion because it brings you "],["458.19","together it really forces you to sit "],["460.62","together and it gets pretty awkward "],["462.3","because that's an intimate thing that we "],["465.36","do and they were they were complaining "],["467.19","about that if he didn't eat and drink "],["471.93","with sinners "],["472.74","who would he eat and drink with wasn't "],["476.61","anybody else he was her no and he spake "],["481.05","this parable so here's the setting "],["484.49","remember these two groups remember "],["486.93","what's taking place remember the "],["488.52","exchange of emotions between these folks "],["491.85","and what they think about Jesus and his "],["493.77","response do that and that's the key that "],["497.76","unlocked a parable we say this the keys "],["500.52","to this parable are hanging at the door "],["502.43","so if you grasp this and understand then "],["505.59","when you come into the parable it'd be a "],["507.12","little easier what man of you having a "],["511.919","hundred sheep if he lose one of them "],["514.74","does not leave the ninety-nine in the "],["516.75","wilderness and go after that which is "],["519.209","lost until he finds it when he had found "],["522.36","it he layeth on his shoulders rejoicing "],["524.839","when he cometh home change in venue here "],["529.5","buzz in the wilderness but he brings "],["531.93","this one home he calls together his "],["535.29","friends and neighbors saying on to him "],["536.85","rejoice with me for I have found my "],["539.4","sheep which lost I say unto you likewise "],["542.55","joy shall be in heaven over one sinner "],["545.1","that repenteth more than over ninety and "],["548.31","nine just persons which need no "],["551.25","repentance and the Pharisees had a "],["552.69","statement "],["554.19","that there was joy in heaven over one "],["557.04","sinner that is obliterated before God so "],["561.93","there's tension here now because Jesus "],["564.51","certainly is adopting a totally "],["566.04","different perspective in terms of the "],["568.23","relationship with the father souls of "],["573.03","men why will ye scatter like a crowd of "],["574.98","frightened sheep foolish hurts why will "],["578.4","you wander from a love so true and deep "],["581.33","was there ever kind of Shepherd half so "],["584.16","gentle half so sweet as the Savior who "],["587.49","would have us come and gather around his "],["590.04","feet for the love of God is broader than "],["593.58","the measure of man's mind and the heart "],["596.61","of the eternal is most wonderfully kind "],["600.15","a hundred sheep you think well if you "],["606.39","got a hundred sheep and you lose once "],["607.8","not a bad not a bad thing you go get "],["610.92","yourself another sheep but the concept "],["613.83","of 100 was important in this environment "],["616.2","and it spoke of your success and your "],["619.74","ability and your accomplishment and "],["621.57","maybe consequently in this context the "],["624.21","blessing of God and to lose one means "],["627.9","you just drop down you're just not quite "],["630.78","there you haven't you haven't come to "],["633.24","the level that you really wanted to come "],["634.92","to so it's very disappointing these "],["638.46","Shepherds also took their sheep very "],["640.59","very intimately didn't they and they "],["644.64","understood even from the Old Testament "],["646.91","Jehovah Rapha "],["649.53","the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want "],["653.94","he maketh me to lie down in green "],["656.37","pastures he leads me beside the still "],["658.41","waters he restores my soul he leadeth me "],["662.37","in the right paths for his name's sake "],["665.1","yea though I walk through the valley of "],["666.75","the shadow of death I what offyour no "],["670.77","evil why for your with me your your rod "],["675.54","and your staff they comfort me surely "],["679.23","goodness and mercy shall follow me all "],["681.93","the days of my life but get this one and "],["684.03","I will dwell where "],["687.99","in the house of the Lord forever these "],["693.54","sheep become family they come home years "],["701.52","ago I was in a prison in Mexico I know "],["705.899","what you're thinking is not true we were "],["710.1","there visiting traveling with a "],["712.56","missionary Mexican gentleman who had "],["715.8","started at that time 50 churches and he "],["719.55","took us down in Victoria I think Mexico "],["722.88","we visited the prison and it was "],["726.24","arresting because we discovered this "],["728.37","that if you go to prison down there and "],["730.339","you don't have any support your children "],["735.24","go to prison with you at that time put "],["737.58","the kids in prison with mom and dad or "],["739.29","whatever the case and there was all boys "],["741.75","and girls running around and they led us "],["744.149","through the main gate took our "],["747.899","identification so on and they put us "],["749.76","radian with the general population it "],["752.04","was pretty intimidating at the time and "],["755.15","some of these fellows were obviously "],["757.47","quite hurtin and some of them were great "],["760.08","artisans one of the ways in which they "],["764.25","supported themselves was they carved out "],["766.709","of ebony different things I have a keen "],["770.04","that I bought and I brought back homes "],["772.2","how they provide it for themselves one "],["776.01","of the fellows had taken and carved "],["778.44","large dinner table large dining room "],["781.529","table out of Ebony and all the chairs "],["783.81","and carved in it the Lord's table the "],["788.7","disciples with the Lord if I had any "],["792.089","kind of roomed I think it was $350 I I "],["795.209","would have brought it back it was a work "],["797.13","of art but walking around in the prison "],["802.14","yard was the toughest looking fellow "],["805.95","there really rough looking character and "],["810.44","following behind him was a lamb a little "],["814.41","pet lamb this fellow had a small lamb in "],["817.2","jail with him was caring for him and it "],["820.26","was obvious that that "],["821.82","that lamb loved his Shepherd and his "],["825.05","Shepherd loved this lamb so that gives "],["829.17","you that helps you get the emotion of "],["831.09","this I know I know I have 99 left but "],["834.87","that doesn't make any difference when "],["836.4","you lose one you really want that one "],["839.64","back if you can either what woman having "],["845.76","ten pieces of silver though their "],["848.88","previous ratio was a hundred to one now "],["851.22","it's ten to one if she lose one piece "],["854.31","does not light a candle and sweep the "],["856.77","house seek diligently till she find it "],["859.7","which she has found it she called with "],["861.96","her friends and her neighbors together "],["863.37","saying rejoice with me for I have found "],["866.25","the peace which I had lost likewise I "],["869.91","say unto you there is joy in the "],["872.46","presence of angels of God over one "],["875.34","sinner that what repenteth okay should "],["880.56","have spent a little time on that concept "],["882.36","of repent at the base of it it simply "],["886.86","means to change your mind it doesn't "],["890.16","mean to be moan and tear your hair out "],["894.57","and grind your teeth over all the things "],["897.81","that you've done it just simply means "],["899.4","that you were going in one direction and "],["901.71","you started to think differently you "],["904.08","presupposed a change of direction and "],["906.09","now you're heading in the other way "],["907.85","that's what repentance is let's not make "],["911.76","it more than it needs to be somehow "],["915.36","God's Spirit illuminates my mind and he "],["919.17","gives me fresh understanding and turns "],["920.97","the lights on I have a change in how I "],["924.3","think and a change in how I work "],["927.71","rejoicing together and the context here "],["932.7","is this lady had this lovely either "],["935.43","necklace or perhaps maybe one that was "],["937.38","on her brow very possibly was an "],["940.14","engagement gift and incredibly important "],["944.19","to her so much so in that culture if you "],["947.13","lost that or a portion of it it was a "],["950.85","sign of unfaithfulness so you can "],["953.43","imagine that she's very concerned "],["955.5","that she finds that and gets it put back "],["958.02","together and of course other folks are "],["960.51","concerned with her yeah and then it has "],["963.54","a good ending and they celebrate "],["966.21","together and he said a certain man had "],["972.57","what two sons now we're down to 50/50 "],["976.76","and the younger of them said to the "],["980.64","father father give me the portion of "],["982.38","goods that falleth to me and he divided "],["986.4","onto them all his living so in this "],["990.48","culture you generally had to wait for "],["993.24","your dad to die before you received your "],["995.97","goods but it was possible and and the "],["998.07","father could initiate this according to "],["999.6","the old testament and he could divide up "],["1002.03","the resources and in the structure the "],["1005.93","eldest son usually got a double portion "],["1009.55","part of it was that he not only cared "],["1012.05","for himself but he also had enough to "],["1013.52","care for his dead though there was some "],["1015.89","of their social net and help and the "],["1019.31","younger son would get to get a third he "],["1023.24","was entitled to ask for that and when he "],["1025.459","asked he he started the process whereby "],["1029.17","the inheritance was divided up nothing "],["1037.069","wrong with that so far and not many days "],["1040.91","after the younger son gathered all "],["1043.22","together and took a journey into a far "],["1046.189","country and there he whittled away he "],["1052.16","went it away Rob Nellie Anna's took us "],["1053.96","for a little Drive last night and we "],["1055.37","went down to MGM casino that's a quite "],["1063.29","an experience we've never been in in one "],["1065.84","of those we've gambled we've taken a lot "],["1068.42","of chances not with any money but we we "],["1071.18","gamble driving down here that we get out "],["1073.01","through the snow and it's just "],["1076.31","incredible beautiful spot lovely very "],["1080.15","nice looking over the harbor but I just "],["1083.15","thought about how much money "],["1086.94","passing through not totally critical "],["1091.9","like to get in on it like to have some "],["1093.52","of it but I just thought about I wonder "],["1097.36","if there was some folks there that were "],["1099.12","winnowing away their wealth their "],["1103.51","inheritance I used to have a fellow I "],["1108.01","worked with he was my manager and after "],["1111.07","he got us pay it the end of the week "],["1113.23","he'd go up to the Air Force Club and he "],["1115.24","would gamble just over numbers on a on a "],["1119.86","bill and I was with him one night he "],["1121.93","lost his whole paycheck just Windell did "],["1125.65","it away and when he had spent all there "],["1133.21","arose a mighty fam and that's when the "],["1134.8","pinch comes when the famine comes and "],["1138.49","you don't have anything left that's when "],["1139.81","in trouble and he began to be in want "],["1142.69","and he went and this is not willingly he "],["1147.16","went and joined himself to a citizen of "],["1149.02","that country and he sent a mote to feed "],["1151.78","the swine my assumption is is this is a "],["1156.28","young Jewish fellow not used to being "],["1160.09","around hogs or pigs and partaking and "],["1163.32","certainly wouldn't have been considered "],["1165.28","a good job and I was telling the folks "],["1168.82","in the earlier service when I was young "],["1170.35","my uncle had a hog farm and we enjoyed "],["1173.59","being around the Hogs and we would catch "],["1178.84","them if they were laying down we would "],["1180.34","catch them and we'd get on their backs "],["1181.69","and there they're quite strong and "],["1184.66","they'd get up and they'd run with you "],["1187.06","and they'd run for a short period of "],["1188.35","time you didn't stay on them long and "],["1191.11","then they'd stopped very abruptly and "],["1192.85","they would put you down where you didn't "],["1195.82","want to be and then you get home and "],["1199.03","your grandmother would give you a "],["1200.08","licking force melons to bed and make you "],["1201.52","stand outside and hose everything off "],["1203.92","and so on that hugs were they were fun "],["1208.78","and if you get an old bore not a "],["1215.38","preacher not someone you're listening to "],["1216.91","but an old an old bore

of "],["183.16","knowledge and what's interesting is the "],["190.33","first thing that I notice and I saw when "],["194.83","I was reading the Bible was actually "],["197.11","watching a movie and it was the 10 "],["198.37","commandments because when I was a little "],["201.7","boy I watched some Ten Commandments and "],["203.71","I loved it and the first thing I noticed "],["208.35","was Moses going up the mountain "],["215.42","and he went up to the mountain and it "],["218.42","was just walking up to the mountain and "],["220.43","all of a sudden he saw the burning bush "],["222.37","well guess what the the burning bush was "],["225.44","telling Moses stop don't come any closer "],["230.6","and why because Moses was all jacked up "],["237.1","Moses didn't know about holiness he "],["240.8","didn't even know the Lord he was going "],["242.72","up to see who the Lord was he had to go "],["245.84","see this burning bush that wouldn't burn "],["247.52","up and what happened when he saw he fell "],["250.88","to his knees and and he realized how "],["260.959","holy God was because then the Lord says "],["265.24","Moses take off your shoes because the "],["269.36","ground that you're on is holy you did "],["273.23","not know about the holiness of God "],["282.69","when's the last time that we were on our "],["284.64","knees before God "],["293.509","when is the last time we were on our "],["295.37","knees before the Lord "],["301.789","one time and here "],["313.57","Moses knew that he was coming in there "],["316.3","and the holiness and the reason why God "],["319.03","had to yell at him and say stop because "],["322.06","Moses he did not know he has just "],["325.69","starting his relationship with the "],["327.52","Father God said that he is a consuming "],["333.64","fire and Hebrews so if he says that he's "],["339.01","a come to a concerning a consuming fire "],["346.35","he was trying to give Moses wisdom say "],["349.48","hey don't throw stuff any closer and "],["354.24","what did he say on his knees on his "],["360.49","knees before God he said Lord Here I am "],["368.1","we need to get on our knees and ask and "],["372.1","say the Lord Lord Here I am Here I am "],["379.35","we get so busy we don't even hear the "],["382.36","holy spirit anymore so we go a whole "],["387.04","year and we really have not heard the "],["389.5","Lord say a word to us "],["391.05","because we're busy doing things this is "],["395.5","the last year of 2017 the reason why "],["400.09","earnestly believe the Lord is having and "],["403.03","saying this message pastor gave me 30 "],["406.06","days to figure out he gave me 30 days "],["408.7","ago he says Rob would you preach and I'm "],["410.92","like thank you Pastor I will but for the "],["413.2","last 30 days I've been toiling over Lord "],["416.08","what is the message I'm not coming here "],["418.75","just to say a message and go home and "],["420.52","say it was fun it was great no my job is "],["425.74","saying Lord what is it so I can be the "],["427.78","mouthpiece of you because you're the one "],["429.73","that's supposed to speak out of me we "],["437.08","need to be on our knees before the Lord "],["441.74","there's a lot of people that are sick "],["444.46","and bring the sick to the church that "],["447.08","that the elders may pray over you "],["449.44","because the Bible says if you bring him "],["451.7","to the elders and lay hands on him deal "],["453.95","the what they'll be healed "],["455.54","do we not believe that we got to get "],["461.78","back to just being servants of the Most "],["465.02","High and to believe that what God has "],["468.02","said is true so Moses is coming and he's "],["473.66","on his face before God and the glory of "],["476.72","God was so immense that he had to cover "],["479.57","his face and talk to the Lord like this "],["482.62","don't think that he was ever ever on his "],["486.02","feet do you remember in the Bible when "],["489.29","you're reading all through the "],["490.22","scriptures every time even an angel "],["492.35","would would come to somebody they said "],["494.9","fear not because they'd be so terrified "],["499.87","so if they're terrified of an angel "],["502.7","how much more literally that God of all "],["505.16","gods that I am that I am "],["514.3","we have sick in our congregation we need "],["516.729","to be on our knees pray if we have "],["520.839","family members that don't know Christ "],["522.51","get on your knees and pray "],["528.31","this is where we belong in 2018 we need "],["533.02","to be on our knees we must fear God "],["536.86","enough to believe and when I say fear in "],["540.46","that content I mean the reverence of God "],["544.32","the reverence of God this is what he "],["549.04","wants to see from his body "],["569.939","he hid his face before the Lord "],["581.94","so while Moses was coming up the "],["583.98","mountain the people got upset because he "],["587.97","was up there for forty days and so the "],["592.83","people got upset and they ran off to "],["595.02","Aaron they say make a God for us that "],["605.1","way maybe we can worship and sacrifice "],["611.3","so Aaron did and what was interesting is "],["616.43","what Aaron said was okay you do it just "],["620.97","go ahead and do it no he says bring the "],["623.94","gold in the earrings to me and I bring "],["627","him to me why because he was going to do "],["630.6","it "],["638.07","he was going to do the ultimate "],["639.98","abomination before God so he made the "],["647.85","calf "],["653.06","wasn't he the same person that went to "],["655.97","Moses to Pharaoh didn't the Lord say "],["661.49","take Aaron because because Moses had a "],["665.779","problem speaking so he said okay take "],["667.97","your brother with you Moses Aaron was "],["673.069","he's witnessed the whole thing he was "],["676.43","there wasn't he therefore the 10 plagues "],["679.18","did he not see all 10 plagues this man "],["685.699","is about to build an altar look he built "],["689.779","the calf then he built the altar and "],["693.279","then he sacrificed did he see the pillar "],["702.199","far did held the Egyptians back did he "],["706.04","not see that did he see the Red Sea part "],["712.54","he saw the Red Sea part "],["715.54","Peet's all the armies coming after him "],["718.22","and and what and they were devoured in "],["720.949","the sea and they all drowned Aaron saw "],["724.279","it this is the same Aaron "],["741.89","why isn't that like Judas's kiss "],["750.879","remember when Jesus coming out and Judas "],["756.609","went off "],["759.29","to get the little coins and then he "],["762.11","threw them after what happened and he "],["764.69","went to Jesus and he kissed them so the "],["768.47","soldiers knew who they were and who he "],["770.149","was isn't this like a Judas Kiss "],["795.199","some of us built a calf in 2017 and you "],["799.67","need to take it out of your homes and "],["801.109","burn it "],["806.44","I'll tell you a story I've gone overseas "],["809.53","and many probably I've been overseas "],["813.94","twice for fourteen months and I went all "],["816.88","over the place I was a Westpac "],["818.83","deployment so I was a Marine "],["820.57","and what's interesting about this is "],["822.76","going to different countries and they'd "],["824.95","have idols I remember going to Singapore "],["827.17","in Singapore is probably one of the most "],["829.42","interesting countries because it's the "],["831.4","most cleanest but there's there's the "],["833.47","most most idols in Singapore I've ever "],["835.3","seen in my life and there they have "],["838.27","stores and it was just full of idols and "],["841.63","idols and idols and remember going in "],["844.39","one at the time I was not too Swift but "],["847.78","I did go in one and I saw this little "],["849.64","thing I really liked I really liked I "],["851.86","was gonna buy it for Melinda and it was "],["853.72","all silver and it was really cool and it "],["856.54","wasn't that expensive pastor it really "],["858.46","wasn't expected Melinda is gonna love it "],["860.47","I took it home and I gave it to her and "],["865.93","she's like ah she loved it and then a "],["871.86","little while later the Lord convicted me "],["876.34","and about what do I have in my house "],["878.95","it's an abomination to God "],["885.46","and so I went to room in the room I "],["887.88","wanted to make sure there was nothing "],["889.75","that was gonna be an abomination in my "],["892.3","house and I saw that and I recognized it "],["896.92","was an idol and was something I should "],["899.17","not have in my house so I took it and do "],["905.8","it away "],["909.08","my wife still to this day has not said "],["912.23","one word I think she just never knew and "],["915.73","maybe because I didn't tell her but we "],["922.4","need to be serious about what we have in "],["923.96","our homes "],["935.25","are we building a calf "],["941.48","sometimes you're gonna build a calf and "],["943.19","we don't even know "],["957.7","- here's Moses he's still up there "],["960.64","getting the Ten Commandments and the "],["963.96","Lord is telling him basically quickly "],["969.97","get down there because they're defiling "],["971.62","themselves but was and I loved the "],["977.68","scripture because this is basically in "],["982.75","Genesis 30 I mean X's 32 10 what it "],["986.17","basically says is this pieces leave me "],["989.56","alone this is God's seed leave me alone "],["991.53","so I can consume them consume them "],["996","here's God's just like hey leave me "],["998.08","alone you know how your friends say hey "],["999.25","just leave me alone "],["1000.03","I don't we bugged as we've seen two most "],["1002.64","leave me alone "],["1011.379","leave me alone that my wrath may burn "],["1013.929","hot against them in Hebrews chapter 12 "],["1021.91","verse 29 it says i'ma consume zooming "],["1025.329","fire interesting after that when he says "],["1030.22","to Moses his interest because it's it's "],["1032.259","almost the same thing he said to Abraham "],["1034.509","he says I'll I'll build you a new nation "],["1040.11","so what's interesting for me when I was "],["1043.539","reading that I was like wow his "],["1045.579","relationship with Abraham was just like "],["1048.25","Moses "],["1057.3","and then Moses says Lord don't consume "],["1063.66","them don't consume them "],["1072.88","Laure was showing grace "],["1089.669","now this is probably the most "],["1092.369","supernatural part of this whole story is "],["1098.489","even in the midst of Aaron doing all of "],["1100.679","that Aaron's the first priest of the "],["1104.369","tabernacle how can that be how can that "],["1114.899","be "],["1115.519","he's sacrificed and made an another God "],["1121.919","an idol and worshiped made to uh the "],["1125.82","altar and literally sacrificed it on it "],["1130.459","how could God choose Aaron after that "],["1136.459","same reason he chose you same every "],["1142.619","single one of us same reason "],["1148.79","what's interesting about Aaron as we go "],["1151.88","through the story "],["1158.669","as Aaron had to be holy to work in the "],["1161.999","tabernacle it was things that had to be "],["1165.029","done there was special garments and it "],["1168.749","was amazing because the special garments "],["1170.519","were pacifically made and we can't go "],["1172.669","into all the aspects of that but there "],["1175.71","is very detailed and what happens is to "],["1181.259","consecrate Aaron and his sons they had "],["1186.84","to take a ram and Moses dipped oil with "],["1192.359","the blood of our Bram and sprinkle it on "],["1195.33","Aaron and his sons and then all their "],["1197.519","garments "],["1207.36","even in the midst of what Aaron did is "],["1210.69","this the most grace we've ever seen in "],["1213.18","all of the Bible could it be "],["1225.41","haven't we sacrificed to idols we got "],["1230.75","all kinds of idols there we're no "],["1234.68","different than Aaron we're no different "],["1240.2","than Aaron this is why this is important "],["1249.49","we're no different "],["1261.09","now that all happened in the same year "],["1263.58","by the way about 1500 almost 1500 years "],["1267.299","before Christ came on the scene "],["1268.919","a year later Aaron and his sons are "],["1277.35","working in the tabernacle doing the "],["1279.33","things of God what's interesting

pray for us is that this church "],["335.77","body would gain independence "],["337.51","independence that they would be able to "],["339.46","depend on themselves for leadership that "],["342.28","they would learn to depend on themselves "],["343.9","through faithful giving that through "],["346.03","their tithes and offerings they would be "],["347.68","able to run the ministries of this "],["349.24","church and to support many missionaries "],["351.58","and then third we ask that you would "],["353.88","pray that God would call out men not "],["357.61","only to leave this

and we couldn't do "],["402.069","what we do without the investment that "],["403.87","you make in our lives in our ministry "],["406.06","financially on a monthly basis but also "],["408.55","more important than the finances you "],["411.069","pray for us and that sustains us able to "],["413.68","give us longevity in ministry and to "],["416.319","minister and preach the gospel so that "],["420.419","people you saw there on the steps or "],["422.77","your brothers and sisters in Christ and "],["424.569","it's because of our partnership and the "],["428.409","Lord using his word to speak to hearts "],["432.339","and to change lives so we would "],["434.86","encourage you after the service to stop "],["437.71","by the table my wife will not be there "],["440.259","she's we've decided that we're gonna "],["442.96","take our son Joey to the MinuteClinic "],["445.599","this morning he's having some issues and "],["448.27","so we're gonna take him there and see "],["449.74","what's going on but I will be there and "],["451.479","I would encourage you to pick up one of "],["453.49","our prayer cards and our prayer cards or "],["455.259","neat tools for you to put on your fridge "],["457.449","put in your Bible put on your nightstand "],["459.759","put so maybe in your office and when you "],["461.8","see this prayer card we just ask that "],["463.719","you take a few minutes to make "],["466","intercessory prayer for our family and "],["467.889","the ministry there in Tanzania you heard "],["471.399","our prayer requests that that that "],["473.08","church would need to be obedient to the "],["474.639","Lord Jesus Christ would continue to "],["476.169","reproduce itself continue to learn and "],["478","lead itself and this morning pastor Robb "],["483.009","has asked me not to speak a message "],["488.099","necessarily from the Word of God but I "],["490.99","trust that as I tell a few testimonies "],["493.21","you will hear and see the Word of God as "],["496.389","it was spoken and taught and received "],["498.939","and in Tanzania because what has "],["503.229","happened in Tanzania and that little "],["504.819","community of Enda sac is really amazing "],["507.819","to us seeing where we "],["508.99","came from the county at the Honan county "],["514.75","there in Tanzania is a County of about "],["516.52","300,000 people of this 300,000 people "],["520.27","it's it's basically made up of two "],["522.28","different tribes the first tribe is a "],["524.86","guayabera bank tribe in the what "],["526.51","bareback tribe or the second most "],["528.94","backwards tribe of 128 tribes in "],["531.79","Tanzania it is you can go into many of "],["537.16","their homes and many of their huts you "],["538.51","can still find the women dressed in the "],["542.2","ghost skinned dresses and and and tops "],["544.99","and you can still find the men in their "],["546.82","traditional wraps with their spears and "],["549.73","their bow and arrows and it's quite "],["550.93","amazing to me it's quite a contrast to "],["553.15","live in Tanzania and the way that "],["555.52","technology is evolving "],["557.2","whereas I'll go into one of these huts "],["558.79","and I'll be speaking with these older "],["560.92","people and these men will be sitting "],["563.89","there and all of a sudden out in the "],["565.33","middle of nowhere their cell phone will "],["566.95","ring and they'll start fishing around "],["568.6","inside of there inside of their robes or "],["572.08","their blankets for cellphone is quite "],["574.21","interesting to me because they don't "],["575.56","wear anything underneath these blankets "],["577.33","so I don't know where they're storing "],["578.56","their cellphones but that's between them "],["581.26","and their cell phone I guess and then "],["584.53","the wire Rakhi tribe is the second most "],["587.5","tribe given over to witchcraft or Satan "],["590.92","Satanism and these guys will and it will "],["594.58","not make excuses for going to the witch "],["596.62","doctor there's quite often even in her "],["600.43","home church I have to encourage them on "],["602.74","Sunday mornings listen you've received a "],["605.17","light this morning don't take yourself "],["606.79","back to the darkness please don't go to "],["608.8","the witch doctor this week you know in "],["610.81","America we say don't remember you're a "],["612.58","Christian seven days a week and in "],["614.17","Tanzania I'm telling them don't go to "],["615.61","the witch doctor you know you don't do "],["617.98","you don't mix any more light and "],["619.6","darkness don't mix and also another "],["622.3","thing that factors into the equation of "],["624.76","doing ministry in the Hunan County is "],["626.44","that the Hunan County from the start of "],["629.17","our county to the end of our county per "],["631.18","capita there's more vodka more vodka "],["633.79","packets and they don't sell them in the "],["635.35","bottle they sell them in little packets "],["637.66","about this size there's more vodka "],["639.82","packets sold in our County "],["641.89","per capita than the rest of the nation "],["644.079","of 52 million people and so you combine "],["647.04","Satanism animism tribalism and "],["650.25","alcoholism together you get a fine "],["652.66","kettle of stew as far as preaching the "],["656.079","gospel it's been very hard going they "],["660.459","have not been receptive to this since "],["662.17","2002 from 2012 until 2015 we started the "],["668.56","church and into 2nd 2012 but from 2012 "],["671.5","to 2015 we've found great resistance to "],["675.339","the point where we had two men one man "],["679.36","was Andrew and he was born in a "],["681.93","born-again and through a like faith "],["685.3","ministry disciple by a like faith "],["687.94","missionary went off to work in the "],["691.209","government and then came back and when "],["693.73","he found out we were gonna start Church "],["695.529","in his village he was all on board and "],["698.23","really it was a great blessing cuz he's "],["700.06","been through a Bible Institute ministry "],["701.74","through that thing and right off the top "],["703.93","he was able to help me preach and teach "],["705.579","and disciple but we didn't have any "],["708.279","people because of the resistance and "],["710.38","Satan really didn't want us in that "],["711.91","village because of some rumors and "],["716.579","threats and all this other stuff we "],["719.649","struggled really struggled deeply "],["721.839","struggle for about three years "],["725.529","the second man that came to know Christ "],["727.779","was a man by the name of Jackson and if "],["730.39","we could put his him and his mom up here "],["732.49","you might have noticed mama Jackson from "],["735.07","the testimony the testimonies in the "],["736.69","video this is a young man named Jackson "],["738.699","and I was able to share the gospel with "],["740.44","him within the first three or four weeks "],["742.149","of starting this church in 2012 and he "],["745.75","decided to repent he said I know I need "],["749.62","to trust Christ but I don't know how I'm "],["751.899","confused as to how to do it and what "],["754.269","happens in Tanzania is really I'm not "],["756.519","going on teaching a gospel to people "],["758.47","that have not heard about Jesus Christ "],["760.029","and his death on the cross but I'm going "],["762.339","out and trying to teach a simple message "],["766.57","of the gospel because it's so much has "],["769.06","been added to it and it causes confusion "],["771.24","really if I go to a funeral in "],["774.579","Sonia I can hear nine different ways "],["777.519","that a person can make sure that he can "],["779.439","go to heaven nine different ways in one "],["782.679","funeral setting and so there's a lot of "],["785.649","different confusion and this man was "],["787.869","confused he said I just want you to show "],["789.67","me from the Bible how I can know how to "],["792.22","receive Jesus Christ my Savior so we "],["794.98","worked them through it in that morning "],["796.689","he received the Lord Jesus Christ as a "],["798.79","savior about three weeks later his "],["801.339","mother I went out and shared the gospel "],["803.379","with his mother and his mother says I "],["805.119","heard I was behind the curtain when you "],["806.799","were leaving my son to Christ and I "],["808.779","understand it I just need to take that "],["810.579","next step to accept him as my savior and "],["812.889","so she was able to bow her head repent "],["815.199","of her sins and receive Jesus Christ as "],["817.749","our Savior and so we had two men in the "],["821.019","church and we had five an average of "],["823.569","five attending for about two and a half "],["825.249","three years now you can imagine giving "],["828.549","your life to missions and given "],["831.429","thousands of dollars and thousand "],["834.489","dollars from this church alone let alone "],["835.929","other churches to sustain us to be able "],["838.569","to live there and it came to the point "],["841.089","where we were going back on furlough "],["842.739","after being there for two and a half "],["844.54","years I was bringing a report back to "],["846.999","churches that we had five people five "],["850.66","people and two of them were really "],["852.759","faithful but those other three were just "],["854.86","like a rotation of people and guests "],["856.72","that just kept on coming to see what was "],["858.429","going on so really we only had about two "],["860.619","or three people in the church I came "],["865.569","back on furlough and started to realize "],["867.97","that we were trying to start a church in "],["870.369","a community without really reaching out "],["873.279","to the community and so we came back and "],["875.47","we really changed the philosophy of how "],["877.54","we did things and we tried to reach out "],["879.699","and be part of that community "],["881.319","go to funerals get involved in community "],["883.749","projects well-drilling someone had "],["886.72","called me from businessman from "],["889.329","Australia had called me out of the blue "],["890.889","and said I'm going to send you money to "],["892.779","drill a well and we were really praying "],["894.91","through all this persecution and these "],["898.139","hard times and and really to the point "],["901.239","where the church got to that we got to "],["903.429","the point in ministry where we were "],["904.629","really wondering whether we should just "],["906.129","dust the the "],["908.529","wipe the dust off our sandals and just "],["910.54","go on because five people in three years "],["914.05","really is not it didn't justify all the "],["918.04","money that was spent to live there and "],["920.35","we just said you know really we're gonna "],["925.63","try this project of drilling this well "],["927.7","and this was something that we thought "],["929.32","of and this is some missionaries used "],["931.21","sometimes to open doors for themselves "],["933.19","and and I remember in in second "],["938.08","Corinthians chapter one verse verses 1 "],["942.04","through 11 Paul paints a picture in his "],["944.65","ministry where Paul you know we always "],["946.39","think about he's up on mountaintops all "],["949.029","the time is starting church after church "],["950.47","after church Paul went through a lot of "],["952.6","persecution and more persecution than "],["955.9","probably good but he just chose to write "],["958.36","about the good and even when he wrote to "],["959.92","his churches there wasn't a lot of good "],["961.42","in there it was more like man you guys "],["963.1","are messing up here here and here and do "],["964.93","this this and this but he wrote about a "],["968.41","time where they had despaired come to "],["970.27","the point where they just wish death "],["971.71","upon themselves he says that they had "],["973.36","received a death sentence and they "],["977.86","despaired the ministry so much that they "],["980.08","just wanted really to die just go ahead "],["982.57","and take me home "],["983.62","and I remember that we got this money

anymore you need to teach us how to "],["1343.23","disciple so we can disciple them and we "],["1345.3","taught them how to disciple others not "],["1348.66","just 15 lessons or 16 lessons it's a

"],["81.929","you're just seeing you know just as soon "],["84.24","as you walk in the room you're like wow "],["85.77","you know this place is incredible "],["87.439","hopefully you've had that

school went on a trip "],["99.21","to Italy and we got to see you know "],["100.71","several culture and historical landmarks "],["102.42","of significance in like Venice and "],["104.609","Florence and Rome and all those places "],["106.1","there's obviously a lot of stuff that "],["108.299","really caught my caught my attention and "],["111.179","being in the Vatican you know the I "],["114.03","guess the capital of Roman Catholicism "],["116.249","you know was was really incredible "],["118.35","itself seeing all the stuff there but "],["119.729","probably what what really took the cake "],["122.34","was was going in the Sistine Chapel "],["125.039","there in the Vatican and that was really "],["127.799","really breathtaking experience being in "],["130.319","there I couldn't believe you know as "],["132.27","soon as I walk in that room what I was "],["134.64","seeing you know that this is surreal "],["137.04","this can't be you know think of the the "],["139.56","creation of God in Adam the fingers "],["143.04","touching like that picture and all that "],["144.39","stuff that's that's the real deal there "],["146.28","Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel "],["147.99","with some 500 years "],["148.78","so as soon as I walked in there I just "],["151.09","was just an all and Wonder and I wanted "],["152.83","to soak up every minute and every little "],["154.42","detail you know the walls and obviously "],["156.34","they're like they're ushering us along "],["157.6","you know we got to go so I want to try "],["159.22","to enjoy every little quiet moment as as "],["161.38","I had in there is they're telling us be "],["163.93","quiet you know guess cuz noise will ruin "],["167.41","the paintings I don't know but anyways I "],["170.65","didn't have a voice to speak anyways I'm "],["172.54","like took my breath away literally you "],["174.34","know couldn't really talk so but that "],["176.47","was just an incredible experience and as "],["178.63","you know as great as something like the "],["180.4","Sistine Chapel is and all the works of "],["182.019","man that we've created in and the "],["184.12","beauties of this of this universe the "],["186.76","natural wonders of the world all that "],["188.709","stuff nothing compares though to being "],["191.17","in the presence of God and then that his "],["195.16","presences blows all those out of the "],["197.83","water really you know and as Greg and "],["200.11","mentioned last week we talked about "],["201.069","being in God's presence you know I "],["202.36","believe we are truly in the presence of "],["205.33","greatness with capital G we are in God's "],["207.85","presence and I want us to to kind of "],["210.37","look more into that this morning as we "],["212.59","we turn to revelation 4 I encourage you "],["215.86","to turn there we're going to get a "],["217","section of Scripture that basically give "],["218.2","us a glimpse into the throne room of "],["220.03","heaven but before I go into this passage "],["223.45","I just want to give a little background "],["224.47","first of all the book of Revelation is a "],["226.87","vision that John the Apostle John I "],["229.42","received from Jesus that talks about the "],["232.54","things that are and also in revelation "],["234.16","119 those that are to take place after "],["236.59","this so clearly there's things in the "],["238.63","book of Revelation that are current "],["240.609","present and some that are yet to happen "],["242.59","in the future but in chapter 4 where "],["244.81","we're going to be at 4 today John's "],["246.34","vision shifts its focus to heaven so "],["248.23","let's read starting in chapter 4 after "],["250.81","this I looked and behold a door standing "],["254.109","open in heaven and the first voice which "],["256.329","I had heard speaking to me like a "],["257.62","trumpet said come up here and I will "],["259.87","show you what my stake place after this "],["261.4","at once I was in the spirit and behold a "],["264.58","throne stood in heaven with one seated "],["266.86","on the throne and he was sat there had "],["268.81","the appearance of Jasper and carnelian "],["270.31","and around the throne was a rainbow that "],["272.5","had the appearance of an emerald around "],["274.6","the throne were twenty-four Thrones and "],["276.16","seated on the throne were twenty-four "],["277.99","elders clothed in white garments with "],["280.21","golden crowns on their heads "],["282.039","from the phone came flashes of lightning "],["284.199","and rumblings and peals of thunder and "],["286.27","before the throne were burning seven "],["288.219","torches of fire which are the seven "],["289.9","spirits of God and before the throne "],["291.849","there was as it were a sea of glass like "],["293.74","crystal and around the throne on each "],["296.8","side of the throne are four living "],["298.149","creatures full of eyes and front and "],["300.039","behind the first living creature like a "],["301.99","lion the second living creature like an "],["304.089","ox the third living creature with the "],["306.039","face of a man and the fourth living "],["307.809","creature like an eagle in flight and the "],["310.18","four living creatures each of them with "],["312.279","six wings are full of eyes all around "],["314.139","and within and day and night they never "],["316.089","cease to say holy holy holy is the Lord "],["319.96","God Almighty who was and is is to come "],["323.979","and whenever the living creatures give "],["326.139","glory and honour and thanks to him who "],["328.24","is seated on the throne who lives for "],["330.069","ever and ever the twenty-four elders "],["331.569","fall down before him who is seated on "],["334.149","the throne and worship Him who lives "],["335.889","forever and ever they cast their crowns "],["337.779","before the throne saying worthy are you "],["340.18","our Lord and God to receive glory and "],["342.819","honor and power for you created all "],["345.279","things and by your will they existed and "],["347.77","were created chapter five then I saw in "],["350.919","the right hand of him who was seated on "],["352.509","the throne a scroll written within and "],["354.879","on the back sealed with seven seals and "],["357.37","I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a "],["359.499","loud voice who is worthy to open the "],["361.659","scroll and break its seals and no one in "],["365.229","heaven or on earth or under the earth "],["367.059","was able to open the scroll or to look "],["368.769","into it and I began to weep loudly "],["370.87","because no one was found worthy to open "],["372.909","the scroll or to look into it and one of "],["375.519","the others said to me weep no more "],["377.259","behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah "],["380.199","the root of David has conquered so that "],["382.479","he can open the scroll in its seven "],["384.189","seals and between the throne and the "],["386.83","four living creatures and among the "],["388.149","elders I saw a lamb standing as though "],["390.189","it had been slain with seven horns and "],["392.62","with seven eyes which are the seven "],["394.059","spirits of God sent out into all the "],["396.279","earth and he went and took the scroll "],["399.009","from the right hand of him who was "],["400.12","seated on the throne and when he had "],["402.009","taken the scroll the four living "],["403.629","creatures and the twenty-four elders "],["404.86","fell down before the lamb each holding a "],["407.74","harp and golden bowls full of incense "],["409.899","which are the prayers of the saints and "],["411.819","they sang a new song saying worthy are "],["414.789","you to take this "],["415.81","grow into open its seals for you were "],["417.76","slain and by your blood you ransom "],["420.25","people for God from every tribe and "],["422.11","language and people and nation and you "],["424.81","have made them a kingdom and priests to "],["426.49","our God and they shall reign on the "],["428.38","earth then I looked and I heard around "],["431.26","the throne in the living creatures and "],["432.61","the elders the voice of many angels "],["434.37","numbering myriads of myriads and "],["436.81","thousands of thousands saying with a "],["438.82","loud voice worthy is the Lamb who was "],["440.95","slain to receive power and wealth and "],["443.53","wisdom and might and honor and glory and "],["446.23","blessing and I heard every creature in "],["448.99","heaven and on earth and under the earth "],["450.43","and in the sea and all that is in them "],["452.53","saying to him who sits on the throne in "],["454.63","to the lamb be blessing in honor and "],["456.94","glory and might forever and ever the "],["459.55","four living creatures said amen "],["462.34","and the elders fell down that's a pretty "],["467.44","powerful stuff ain't it it's a lot to "],["469.9","cover too so that's why we went so long "],["471.61","last service I apologize so here we see "],["474.94","the heavenly throne room on display we "],["477.46","get a glimpse into it through John's "],["478.75","vision as it said the door standing open "],["480.97","in heaven we get to look and see what it "],["483.07","looks like in heaven this heavenly "],["484.33","worship service and it's a really "],["485.5","awe-inspiring view hopefully you got "],["488.53","that impression as we were reading "],["489.7","through it "],["490.15","and I think this scene in heaven should "],["494.08","serve as an example to us is what "],["495.76","biblical worship should look like I "],["498.01","think we can take a lot of good notes "],["500.08","from this passage here of heavenly "],["502.06","worship that applies to our lives here "],["503.979","now and what biblical worship really "],["505.479","looks like just straight from the Bible "],["507.039","right so there's several elements I want "],["508.78","to look at here today and there's "],["510.31","probably more we could list but I'm just "],["511.75","going to focus on 6 for today we're "],["514.03","going to talk about and before I go in "],["515.62","this just click sign out a lot of these "],["517","elements of worship that I found we're "],["518.709","from a book called what the Bible "],["520.33","teaches about worship which is by Robert "],["522.49","L Dickey so if you're interested in "],["524.26","studying this on your own or learning "],["525.94","more about it I have the book so yeah "],["528.28","it's good stuff all right so the first "],["530.77","element a biblical worship that I see in "],["533.56","this passage here is that biblical "],["535.69","worship is God centered kind of makes "],["539.17","sense right we think hopefully biblical "],["541.48","worship is God centered it's all about "],["543.61","him we hopefully see that here in this "],["544.959","passage he is the center point of all he "],["547","is the focus what's the first thing that "],["549.01","John see "],["549.64","in his vision it says and behold a "],["551.92","throne stood in heaven with one seated "],["554.08","on the throne so the first thing John "],["555.79","sees in the vision is the throne and "],["557.53","that's God on the throne that is the "],["559.12","centerpiece upon which everything in "],["561.22","this vision that we look at is revolved "],["563.41","around it's all about the one on the "],["564.94","throne as we see mentioned several times "],["566.2","throughout this passage it's all about "],["568.24","God and these verses served to describe "],["571.57","his grandeur and the splendor on that "],["573.7","throne it's such a glorious image to see "],["576.28","that in the one who is on the throne and "],["579.07","our human language you know cannot fully "],["581.08","or possibly describe it in every way and "],["583.63","what John is giving here is you know "],["585.04","it's just a mere taste I think of what "],["587.59","he actually saw because human language "],["589.3","is not capable of fully describing the "],["591.64","beauty and grandeur of God but we're "],["593.53","going to look at the images he's given "],["595.09","here just a little bit just to kind of "],["596.32","get a feel so I thought about you know "],["598.06","putting a picture up on the screen "],["599.2","because some artists have an "],["600.73","interpretation of like what this throne "],["602.29","room scene looks like and you can find "],["604.03","some that stuff online if you're "],["604.99","interested but I thought if I put that "],["606.73","up there it might kind of like you know "],["608.94","bias to you the way you're thinking so I "],["610.93","wanted to just use it your god-given "],["612.57","imagination and creativity to picture "],["614.92","this of what this must have been for "],["617.11","John to see what the throne room is like "],["619.51","so first of all we see on verse three he "],["622.54","who sat there had the appearance of "],["623.86","Jasper and carnelian so I don't know if "],["626.74","you're like me and the first question I "],["628.21","had is what's Jasper you know beside the "],["630.37","person's name - hey Jess but what comes "],["632.35","up to 7576 that's the spirit nobody gets "],["636.73","that Three Stooges reference thank you "],["638.29","Dave nobody in first service apparently "],["640.42","did and this is way way before my time "],["643.32","so what's Jasper so I did a little "],["645.91","research on this look into it and Jasper "],["647.89","is is a gemstone we actually have a "],["649.75","Jasper today but scholars believe that "],["652.72","the Jasper gemstone that we know today "],["654.64","it's kind of a reddish darkest you know "],["657.34","brown color it's not the same as the one "],["659.83","that was referenced in the Bible they "],["661.54","believe that this biblical Jasper was "],["663.46","kind of more like a diamond you know in "],["665.41","the sense of it's brilliant it was "],["666.61","crystal it was it refracted light you "],["669.34","know all throughout it got that kind of "],["670.93","idea so imagine like this bright clear "],["673.24","light you know that has all the colors "],["675.64","of the rainbow coming out from it and "],["676.93","that's kind of I think the idea here "],["678.34","that this is coming from the throne it's "],["680.5","bright light you know and obviously this "],["682.93","is our best "],["683.66","way to do it from our our physical you "],["686.69","know mortal point of view to draw and to "],["689.6","imagine this so obviously I don't think "],["692.27","it was literally Jasper or diamond but "],["694.07","this is the way that he's describing it "],["696.02","so then the second gemstone we have is "],["697.67","carnelian in carnelian or maybe sardius "],["700.52","it has in some translations is basically "],["703.4","a red gem and so if you kind of put "],["705.44","these together you know it's an "],["706.28","interesting visual you think of this "],["707.72","bright white light and the light "],["709.22","reflecting through it in this clay "],["710.36","crystal clear and then there's this red "],["712.31","reddish gem you know and I think about "],["714.35","white and red sort of thing you know "],["716.6","like those are pretty common biblical "],["718.25","colors in the imagery right and we think "],["720.38","about our sins are stained like crimson "],["722.99","and yet well washed away by the blood of "],["725.15","the Lamb being white as snow and I think "],["727.43","it's a really cool picture of all that "],["728.78","stuff but what I think was the most "],["731.33","interesting fact about these gems is if "],["733.82","we go back to the Old Testament the "],["736.19","breastplate of the priests that they "],["737.66","would wear had twelve stones one to "],["740","represent each tribe of Israel and the "],["741.89","first and last stone respectively were "],["743.84","the Jasper and the carnelian so I think "],["746.66","it's a pretty interesting point that "],["749.54","John observes this image because it "],["751.58","speaks to the Eternity of God right the "],["753.68","first and last tribe of Israel God is "],["755.87","the first and the last the beginning in "],["757.7","the end the Alpha and Omega and we read "],["759.44","this earlier in Revelation so I think "],["761.06","these images also speak to his "],["762.89","eternality that he is the beginning in "],["764.54","the end God is of all times before and "],["767.57","he always will be it's a really cool "],["769.46","picture so let's move on a little bit "],["771.53","further to see some more of the images "],["772.85","in this passage in verse 5 we read from "],["775.91","the throne came flashes of lightning and "],["777.89","rumblings and peals of thunder and I "],["780.98","think these images can only further you "],["782.9","know demonstrate God's power right when "],["784.55","you think of a thunderstorm and the "],["785.66","lightning strikes and the rumbling of "],["787.46","thunder and you know it's a powerful "],["788.71","sensation because you can hear thunder "],["790.64","miles away and this kind of sensation I "],["793.13","imagine you know the thunder and "],["794.75","lightning around the throne like that "],["796.25","would strike fear in the hearts of men "],["797.75","you know and it does show that Almighty "],["799.76","God and his power and his greatness "],["801.8","because just think of everybody who has "],["803.84","ever encountered God and the flesh Moses "],["806.27","would take off your sandals free on holy "],["807.86","ground right "],["808.52","anybody see God would have to die you "],["810.74","know he's not powerful he's that holy so "],["813.83","I think this image speaks to his his "],["815.99","power his "],["817.64","and the only proper response then just "],["819.77","like most of them did what are the "],["821.06","elders do they fall down before him in "],["823.94","worship that's the only response that "],["825.77","you could have when you come before "],["826.97","Almighty God and the throne and seeing "],["829.52","that so biblical worship is is the "],["834.26","audience-participation part of the "],["835.52","sermon God's Center thank you all right "],["838.46","that's the first element we see here now "],["840.38","the second one is hopefully pretty "],["842.6","common biblical worship is praised all "],["846.32","right "],["846.62","but what's praised when we use this word "],["849.17","a lot right we throw it around in our "],["850.7","circles but what really is praise well "],["853.3","Nicky the guy I was talking about "],["855.32","earlier he gives this definition of "],["856.91","praise he says praise is the verbal and "],["860","heartfelt response of God's redeemed "],["862.07","people in adoration for all that God is "],["864.56","and for all that God has done and John "],["867.47","MacArthur also gives a similar "],["868.64","definition "],["869.15","he says praise involves three elements "],["871.72","naming God's attributes naming God's "],["874.61","works and offering thanks since the "],["877.43","theme here first of all praise is verbal "],["881.03","right praise is something that we have "],["883.31","to verbalize now I don't think this "],["885.02","means that it has to always be done out "],["887.03","loud you can verbalize it in your heart "],["888.95","and sing praise the Lord in your heart "],["890.54","but my question is if God's given you a "],["893.03","voice to be cute enough to the voice why "],["894.74","don't we praise them with it "],["895.82","why not praise them out loud you don't "],["898.01","just have to praise them in your heart "],["898.94","praising them out loud verbally say Lord "],["901.13","I praise you for who you are for your "],["903.23","awesomeness for your infinite for your "],["905.27","turn ality for your grace for your love "],["907.1","you praise them wherever you are "],["908.36","whenever you can praise them in all "],["910.1","times and it's an interesting thing "],["912.14","because praise is an active response "],["915.38","rooted on who God is when he's done as "],["917.45","we saw in these definitions so why would "],["921.41","we ever have a time where we can't "],["923.81","praise God right we should be able to "],["926.18","praise God at all times in all places "],["927.86","where else could we praise God psalm "],["930.77","34:1 says I will bless the Lord at all "],["933.38","times his praise shall continually be in "],["935.69","my mouth we can live that verse out "],["937.64","because there's nothing to stop us from "],["939.5","praising God if praise is based on who "],["941.81","he is and what he's done then there's no "],["944.96","reason for us not to praise him because "],["946.64","he never changes and what he's done "],["948.41","can't be reversed so there's always "],["950.839","reason to praise "],["951.62","as hard as it may seem in difficult "],["953.45","times and I know I've been there you "],["954.92","know we don't feel like phrasing him "],["956.3","other than mean we can't we can praise "],["958.13","him at any time and we should praising "],["960.29","all the time so now that we have a solid "],["963.05","grasp on what praise is let's take a "],["964.76","look and see how it's actually "],["966.01","exemplified in this throne room scene so "],["969.38","if we go down to verse 6 we see the four "],["972.53","living creatures introduced here and I "],["974.36","consider them to be like the eternal "],["976.04","praisers right they're praising the one "],["977.84","on the throne and these four living "],["979.76","creatures are definitely angelic beings "],["981.5","many scholars think these are probably "],["983.57","the cherubim you know kind of the "],["984.74","cherubim that I Isaiah saw in his his "],["987.5","vision or Jermel actually not those ones "],["989.6","the ones in Ezekiel 10 people say "],["992.27","they're very similar to the ones Ezekiel "],["993.77","10 so either way they're in gellick "],["995.78","beings and so in verse eight we read "],["997.55","that these four living creatures each of "],["999.53","them with six wings are full of eyes all "],["1001.3","around and within and day and night they "],["1003.4","never cease to say holy holy holy is the "],["1006.58","Lord God Almighty who was and is it is "],["1009.85","to come now of course this is a popular "],["1012.01","refrain that we all know right we hear "],["1013.48","it in many of our songs and even the one "],["1015.79","we just sang right this is very popular "],["1017.89","refrain so what is what is the essence "],["1020.08","of it what does it speak to first of all "],["1021.91","I think the thing that stands out is "],["1023.23","God's holiness right we hear holy holy "],["1025.45","holy and I think it's important and "],["1028.48","significant the fact that it's given "],["1030.49","three three times you know threefold "],["1032.35","form this kind of repetition the Bible "],["1034.33","you know you look to other places you "],["1035.95","see the repetition it's meant to "],["1037.18","emphasize the significance and "],["1038.83","importance of something so if we're "],["1040.209","saying God is holy holy holy he's really "],["1043.12","holy God is the definition of holiness "],["1045.43","holiness is rooted in who he is he is "],["1047.59","the holy one it's core to his essence an "],["1050.71","edge screws and aw Tozer I think even "],["1052.93","goes so far to say as God's holiness is "],["1055.24","kind of the source of all of his other "],["1056.89","attributes it all is rooted in his "],["1058.63","holiness you can't get away from the "],["1060.79","holiness of God it's so intrinsic to who "],["1062.65","he is and that's what this refrain "],["1064.03","obviously speaks to but we also see here "],["1066.97","him called the Lord God Almighty and you "],["1069.25","know that the the name Almighty "],["1070.45","obviously speaks to his power right we "],["1072.61","think of the mighty fortress is our God "],["1074.62","so he's the powerful one he's the holy "],["1076.72","one similarly "],["1077.8","he's the one who was and is and is to "],["1080.05","come we kind of saw this earlier already "],["1081.94","he's the eternal one right he's always "],["1084.52","been "],["1085.37","he always is he always will be God is "],["1087.38","outside of time and space "],["1088.55","so he's the one worthy of our praise "],["1090.86","because of all that he is and so I think "],["1093.08","verse 9 summarizes what these four "],["1095.39","living creatures are doing really well "],["1096.559","when it says they give glory and honor "],["1099.14","and thanks to him who is seated on the "],["1100.79","throne who lives for ever and ever "],["1102.559","so biblical worship is praise right all "],["1107.9","right so another element with a corset "],["1110.33","that we see here is that biblical "],["1112.58","worship is liturgical now you may be "],["1115.79","thinking whoa what that's not like a "],["1118.309","term we use around here or that's kind "],["1120.5","of a strange one especially in a modern "],["1122.66","evangelical churches we don't really "],["1124.34","think of liturgy as necessarily a good "],["1127.82","thing "],["1128.12","I think there's reason for that because "],["1130.13","if you often look in certain contexts "],["1132.05","especially the Catholic Church I think "],["1133.64","is a prime example of how liturgy can be "],["1136.19","seen as a negative thing and it's "],["1137.45","basically a mindless meaningless "],["1139.55","repetition but I want to emphasize here "],["1143.059","that liturgy is not necessarily a bad "],["1144.62","thing and in fact there is biblical "],["1146.809","basis for as we're going to see in this "],["1148.25","passage but going back to my trip in "],["1151.309","Italy as I mentioned earlier in addition "],["1153.559","you know to that sense of awe and wonder "],["1154.73","I had being in those cathedrals and the "],["1156.89","Sistine Chapel and all that stuff there "],["1158.69","was also this saddening since I had you "],["1161.179","know being threw out there because kind "],["1163.13","of juxtaposed with all of these "],["1164.66","beautifully design and architecture "],["1166.61","cathedrals is many people who are just "],["1170.33","living in cold lifeless religion you "],["1173.6","know and we talk about you know how a "],["1174.92","church should not be a museum for Saints "],["1176.42","for the hospital for sinners that sort "],["1177.83","of thing you know "],["1178.76","these cathedrals were literally museums "],["1180.679","you know you go and take a tour in there "],["1181.94","and you see all the stuff in there and "],["1183.23","sadly though the people in there are "],["1185.33","part of the museum dead and lifeless "],["1186.98","without hope in life in Christ and it's "],["1189.08","really a sad thing in our group you know "],["1190.97","who went there was deeply moved by this "],["1192.8","and probably the most striking instance "],["1195.23","of this was not actually in the "],["1196.73","cathedrals but was actually at the skull "],["1198.86","of Santa the scholar Santa is basically "],["1201.29","these holy steps of what it means and in "],["1203.72","there in Rome they're believed to be the "],["1205.76","steps that Jesus had gone up as he was "],["1208.19","brought before Pontius Pilate and so "],["1209.929","apparently these steps were brought from "],["1211.19","Jerusalem to Rome and this site is "],["1213.53","considered kind of a pilgrimage site for "],["1215.84","Christians just like mecca is for the "],["1217.67","Muslim many Christians go here to the "],["1219.89","muscala Santa and according to Catholic "],["1221.84","decree the only way you can go up is on "],["1224.57","your hands and knees you have to ascend "],["1226.76","these stairs these holy steps on your "],["1229.28","hands and knees and by doing so you "],["1231.26","actually earn an indulgence you know "],["1233.75","which basically removes some of the "],["1235.37","punishment for your sin so knowing all "],["1237.38","that you know in our group going in here "],["1238.85","we see these people going up and "],["1240.68","climbing on these steps obviously trying "],["1242.3","to be penitent before the Lord and "],["1244.04","seeking to earn their salvation "],["1245.39","basically you know and reduce the "],["1247.25","punishment from God and it was such a "],["1249.26","sad image for us to see know these "],["1251.3","people who are lost without Christ and "],["1253.43","hopeless going through this meaningless "],["1255.44","repetition as I was saying our about "],["1257.9","liturgy it's just you know one step "],["1259.67","after the other but what is this outward "],["1261.35","thing really going to do and so that "],["1264.38","reminded me of the the sadness of "],["1266.45","liturgy that I see in the Catholic "],["1268.04","Church but again liturgy doesn't have to "],["1270.65","be a bad thing and it really in its "],["1273.53","essence refers to order in a corporate "],["1275.39","worship setting having some sort of "],["1276.89","structure in order to what we do and "],["1278.98","it's completely lines but what we see in "],["1281.21","the Bible what does Paul say about "],["1282.83","corporate worship in first Corinthians "],["1284.18","1440 he says that all things should be "],["1286.64","done decently and in order so we're not "],["1289.73","you know just chaotic all over the place "],["1291.83","but we should have order and I think you "],["1293.99","can look at pretty much any church and "],["1295.28","see order look at us for example right "],["1297.17","we have opening song greeting "],["1299.44","announcements praising prayer requests "],["1302","offering song more songs sermon "],["1305.63","communion or closing song sometimes "],["1308.24","though we like to mix it up and I do too "],["1309.8","opening songs so see we're really we're "],["1312.32","really cutting edge here so you can see "],["1315.71","order and structure is not a bad thing "],["1317.21","you know every church has some sort of "],["1318.83","order sequence they follow and it's good "],["1321.47","that we do that we just have to be on "],["1322.88","guard against making it mindless "],["1324.89","repetition like I said as often as seen "],["1327.05","in the Catholic Church where this has "],["1328.19","become a meaningless ritual that we walk "],["1330.26","through so how is this liturgy "],["1332.09","demonstrate in the passage okay well if "],["1334.01","we go back to verse 9 we see the "],["1335.87","language here indicates there's an order "],["1337.61","that's followed and whenever the living "],["1339.41","creatures give glory and honor and "],["1341.27","thanks to him who is seated on the "],["1342.53","throne who lives for ever and ever the "],["1344.18","24 elders fall down before him who is "],["1346.16","seated on the throne and worship Him who "],["1347.81","lives forever the caster's from crowns "],["1350.57","before the throne saying worthy are you "],["1352.49","our Lord and "],["1353.45","to receive glory and honor and power if "],["1355.399","you create all things and by your will "],["1356.84","they existed and were created so this is "],["1359.51","what I like to call the pattern of "],["1360.83","praise first we saw the four living "],["1363.11","creatures give praise right and then the "],["1365.48","elders followed and they bowed down "],["1367.399","before the one on the throne and they "],["1369.169","gave praise as well and if you notice "],["1371.36","the language the very beginning it says "],["1372.559","and whenever the living creatures give "],["1374.69","glory and honor "],["1375.44","then the twenty-four elders fall down so "],["1377.899","this language seems to show that this is "],["1379.639","a repeated process that goes that they "],["1382.1","go through this the pattern of praise "],["1383.419","that happens here in the heavenly "],["1385.039","worship scene so clearly repetition that "],["1387.169","sort of repeater process it's not a bad "],["1388.549","thing like I was saying it's just it can "],["1390.47","be taken to a point where it becomes "],["1392.51","just mindless repetition jump through "],["1394.19","hoops and I think that's something we "],["1395.24","all I know I have to be aware of we all "],["1397.159","have to be constant aware of in our own "],["1398.809","hearts that we're not doing things just "],["1400.73","going through the motions and our hearts "],["1402.5","are truly in worship of them and of "],["1404.899","course we're not given a set order of "],["1406.46","service like where did where is it "],["1408.62","written that we do two songs in the "],["1410.36","beginning or one song and then we do "],["1411.889","offering and do communion apposite right "],["1414.08","doesn't say that anywhere in scripture "],["1415.279","Paul never said thou must do offering "],["1417.679","you know before communion or whatever "],["1420.1","but we do have some examples and you "],["1424.909","know encouragement of how we should "],["1426.289","follow teachings regarding a worship "],["1427.76","service "],["1428.12","I think the prime example this would be "],["1429.98","acts 2:42 you know this is right after "],["1432.94","Peter gave his sermon Pentecost and the "],["1435.679","church was basically born this was the "],["1437.69","birth of church so it's a new born "],["1438.799","church three thousand believers got "],["1440.63","saved the church is on fire obviously "],["1443.299","they're growing they're flourishing and "],["1444.86","look what they do in acts 2:42 and they "],["1447.26","devoted themselves to be possible "],["1448.639","teaching in the fellowship to the "],["1450.169","breaking of bread in the prayers so "],["1452.179","that's I think what we should follow "],["1453.5","that's what we should be about and I "],["1454.669","think here at Faith Bible Church were "],["1456.019","we're pretty good about following those "],["1457.76","things so there is that sort of sense of "],["1460.279","ordering structure we have so may we not "],["1462.679","discard completely with ordered "],["1464.179","structure but may we not will not fall "],["1466.49","into the temptation of mindless "],["1468.32","meaningless repetition which is devoid "],["1470.779","of true worship in connecting with our "],["1472.07","Savior that's the main idea here so "],["1474.2","biblical worship is liturgical hopefully "],["1480.139","maybe some of you learned a new word "],["1481.13","today all right "],["1483.35","biblical worship is focused on Christ "],["1486.34","wait what we said biblical worship is "],["1489.26","God's Center right how can be focused on "],["1490.669","Christ yes "],["1492.919","Christ is God that's right of course "],["1497.24","Mike how silly of me yes "],["1500.59","biblical worship is focused on Christ if "],["1502.88","it's God centered it's going to be "],["1504.44","centered on Christ as well so but we see "],["1506.779","that clearly evidenced here that Christ "],["1508.7","is the focus and it's interesting to see "],["1512.24","what is the reason for the focus on him "],["1514.669","so let's look at chapter 5 now where we "],["1516.23","get a new image in John's vision so you "],["1519.019","know John notices the the scroll and the "],["1521.33","right hand of him on the throne and the "],["1523.01","angel asks you know who is worthy to "],["1524.72","open the scroll and break it seals and "],["1526.7","no one in heaven on earth so under the "],["1528.559","earth was able to open the scroll to "],["1529.909","look into it and I just I love the way "],["1531.44","that this all unfolds here watch this "],["1533.87","and I began to weep loudly because no "],["1536.45","one was found worthy to open the scroll "],["1538.19","to look into it so John is sorrowful "],["1541.309","here because there is no one found "],["1542.48","worthy no one is worthy to open the "],["1544.49","scroll you know it's kind of like the "],["1546.08","sword in the stone right who is worthy "],["1547.639","to pull the sword out of the stone then "],["1549.529","there comes along King Arthur or "],["1550.88","soon-to-be King Arthur it's kind of "],["1552.289","similar idea right who's worthy to open "],["1553.669","the scroll nobody can be found and "],["1555.59","heaven on earth or under the earth "],["1556.639","they've searched the far and wide to all "],["1558.47","the corners and John is weeping because "],["1561.169","no one can be found but then we see the "],["1563.99","hope here right in verse five one of the "],["1566.059","others said to me weep no more behold "],["1568.25","the line of the tribe of Judah the root "],["1569.929","of David has conquered so that he can "],["1571.909","open the scroll in its seven seals yes "],["1574.85","there is someone worthy and in John I "],["1576.919","can imagine is overjoyed which is "],["1578.929","probably understatement actually at this "],["1581.179","news that there is someone worthy and so "],["1583.25","then we get the grand reveal "],["1584.389","of the one worthy to open in verse six "],["1586.58","and between the throne and the four "],["1588.98","living creatures and among the elders I "],["1590.45","saw a lamb standing as though it had "],["1592.7","been slain with seven horns and with "],["1594.83","seven eyes which are the seven spirits "],["1596.51","of God sent out into all the earth and "],["1598.25","he went and took the scroll from the "],["1599.84","right hand of him who was seated on the "],["1601.13","throne and we had taken the scroll the "],["1603.44","four living creatures in the twenty-four "],["1604.76","elders fell down before the lamb each "],["1606.38","holding a harp and golden bowls full of "],["1608.179","incense which are the prayers of the "],["1609.26","saints so obviously the lamb in this "],["1611.63","passage is Jesus Christ the lamb who "],["1614.12","explained as as it so clearly notes "],["1616.669","is not just any lamb the one who "],["1617.84","explained the Passover lamb the final "],["1620.48","sacrifice to end all sacrifices he is "],["1622.639","the one and it's also interesting to "],["1624.35","note this same John writing the book of "],["1626.299","Revelation same one who wrote the Gospel "],["1628.46","of John who uses so much theme semantic "],["1631.7","language talking about Christ as the "],["1633.499","Passover lamb so it's interesting you "],["1635.239","know that we see that imagery of the "],["1636.409","lamb here as well Jesus is the Lamb who "],["1638.389","explained for our sins and of course the "],["1641.139","response of the four living creatures "],["1643.249","and $24.00 again right fall down and "],["1646.34","worship they bow down before him because "],["1648.98","he is worthy but not only because of who "],["1651.409","he is but because of what he's done "],["1652.669","right his finished work on the cross on "],["1654.619","our behalf should be reason as well to "],["1656.869","worship Him the Lamb who was slain for "],["1658.58","our sins and who also we worship other "],["1661.429","than one who has saved us so biblical "],["1664.73","worship is focused on Christ yes all "],["1670.73","right so what's the response after they "],["1673.789","bow down though let's continue in verse "],["1675.35","verse number nine and then they sang a "],["1679.399","new song this introduces our next "],["1681.889","element the vocal worship is music "],["1685.039","really you don't say yep you heard me "],["1688.46","music music is an element of worship "],["1691.34","believe it or not now I know you guys "],["1693.619","don't personally think this is a "],["1694.999","difficult truth it's not hard for us to "],["1696.98","swallow that here in 21st century "],["1698.33","America I think on contrary we we "],["1701.179","overemphasize music and we kind of "],["1703.369","elevate it to this point where music you "],["1706.519","know is essentially worship and worship "],["1709.669","is only defined by music basically if "],["1713.149","you sing a song - god that's worship "],["1714.47","that's it worship is defined by that and "],["1716.33","obviously it's not the case that we've "],["1717.919","seen right worship is so much more than "],["1719.809","that the rest of this passage this whole "],["1722.09","this whole worship scene that we're "],["1723.769","seeing here in the throne room it's not "],["1725.48","just about music music is just a mere "],["1727.159","part of it but music is a part so let's "],["1729.499","look at verse 9 and see the song that

at the lyrics of this song I think "],["1755.929","these lyrics are important because this "],["1757.73","tur probably influenced the lyrics of "],["1759.289","the songs that we sing or the songs that "],["1760.88","we write in church "],["1761.84","first of all we see the emphasis on "],["1764.24","Christ being the sacrifice right the one "],["1766.82","who has died the one who is slain his

is looking at a future "],["1785.84","hope of the Ransom people so I believe "],["1788.659","our songs of praise the worship can be "],["1791.72","focused not only as desk but also on our "],["1794.45","future hope in Christ and you know it's "],["1797.63","kind of standing to me that you know "],["1799.22","what we have a lot of great songs about "],["1801.919","the cross and Jesus

"],["1817.82","takeaway from here and lastly another "],["1819.47","takeaway I would have from this song is "],["1821.69","that our lyrics should be doctrinally "],["1823.64","sound an adult exalting to the Lord "],["1825.74","right obviously has to be sound doctrine "],["1828.049","this has to be glorifying to God we "],["1829.909","can't be worshiping him if we're singing "],["1831.44","heresy "],["1832.669","you know God you are two and one no that "],["1835.309","doesn't work perfect Trinity three and "],["1837.89","one so we have to be doctrinally sound "],["1839.99","and that's something important in all "],["1841.1","four Alex or myself or whoever's leading "],["1842.659","every week each and every week as we're "],["1844.669","preparing the songs that we need to go "],["1845.96","through this process and really make "],["1847.49","sure that what we're singing is "],["1848.78","doctrinally sound it's glorifying "],["1850.669","exalting to the Lord and I say that as "],["1853.88","well because I think there's a tendency "],["1855.71","of some modern songs to focus more on a "],["1858.38","relationship with God in our nearness "],["1860.059","which is true to the detriment of his "],["1863.809","holiness and his transcendence and that "],["1865.61","we talk about God being so close that we "],["1867.47","forget that he is still high above us "],["1869.75","use the Holy One just as the strongroom "],["1871.34","scene is showing and honestly I will say "],["1873.5","the hymns do a lot better job at "],["1875.69","portraying God's holiness and his "],["1877.46","transcendence I wish some of the modern "],["1879.59","songs would do a better job of that so "],["1880.73","that's why I still sing the hymns I "],["1882.02","believe they're good important you know "],["1883.37","most of them "],["1883.85","solid obviously there's always some "],["1885.62","little iffy ones in there but I think "],["1888.53","the hymns do a really good job at that "],["1889.94","and I wish more of the contemporary "],["1892.13","songs could focus on his holiness as "],["1893.9","well and not just you know his nearness "],["1895.73","I don't want it to be you know an "],["1897.44","either/or but it's a both and so I think "],["1900.26","this is good in considerations for us to "],["1902.21","have lastly on music to go to verse 11 "],["1906.559","and 12 there's another important aspect "],["1908.45","of worship that I think does apply to "],["1911.179","music so we read then I looked and I "],["1914.12","heard around the throne and living "],["1915.38","creatures and the elders the voice of "],["1916.7","many angels numbering myriads and "],["1918.95","Myriad's and thousands of thousands "],["1920.63","saying with a loud

"],["1942.26","deserves loud praise to his name and "],["1944.57","obviously there is biblical mandate for "],["1947","that and precedent we can see it here in "],["1949.49","this passage alone but not only here "],["1951.5","were commanded to shout for joy and I "],["1954.11","remember Greg talked about make a joyful "],["1955.85","noise to the Lord no it doesn't have to "],["1957.62","be in

"],["1966.23","I found that talked about this command "],["1968.09","to shout for joy they're all in Psalms "],["1970.669","least the ones I have we have Psalm 33 3 "],["1972.5","Psalm 35 27 747 one which also mentions "],["1976.46","clapping by the way I don't know whether "],["1978.08","in rhythm or not but psalm 66 1 & 2 "],["1980.929","Psalm 81 1 Psalm 95 1 Psalm 98 for Psalm "],["1984.65","101 "],["1985.159","psalm 115 should I keep going okay I "],["1987.65","think you get the idea we were called to "],["1990.14","shout for joy when we sing and I believe "],["1992.84","it should be done joyfully and loudly it "],["1995.929","doesn't have to be you know in tune it "],["1998.03","can be a little pitchy God doesn't mind "],["1999.85","so biblical worship is music alright so "],["2004.51","the last element biblical worship we're "],["2006.52","going to look here is that biblical "],["2007.9","worship is adoration and I think this is "],["2011.559","another one that requires a little "],["2012.82","definition so dickie defines adoration "],["2015.49","as an aspect of worship "],["2017.86","where the worshiper is so moved awed and "],["2020.89","stunned by the sense of the glory and "],["2022.84","majesty of God that he falls prostrate "],["2025.03","before him that's a good definition so "],["2028.27","let's see if there is an example of this "],["2030.28","adoration here in our text okay so verse "],["2032.77","13 we see all creation join in with this "],["2035.71","heavenly song that the angels and the "],["2037.63","elders are singing on the two the one on "],["2039.94","the throne the lamb was slain and they "],["2041.41","say to him who sits on the throne and to "],["2043.42","the lamb be blessing and honor and glory "],["2045.73","and might forever and ever and then "],["2047.71","John's vision here of the heavenly "],["2049.389","throne room worship service and with the "],["2051.909","four living creatures saying amen and "],["2054.49","the elders fell down and worshiped okay "],["2056.98","so I think the end of the service kind "],["2059.169","of shows adoration of the one who is "],["2062.32","worthy they are so in awe of God by a "],["2064.69","splendor and majesty that they can't "],["2067.359","help but fall prostrate before him and "],["2070","humble submission and if we do a little "],["2073.24","worse study on the word worship in the "],["2074.74","Bible we can see where this comes from "],["2076.57","because the Hebrew word that's commonly "],["2078.52","used for worship is actually called a "],["2080.5","Chaka which means to bow down who "],["2083.59","prostrate oneself and in the Greek word "],["2086.08","which is most commonly used for worship "],["2087.609","is proskuneo and that it comes from the "],["2090.73","root which means to kiss towards as in "],["2092.83","you kiss the ground when falling "],["2094.78","prostrate before superior so with that "],["2097.99","in mind we can see how everything that's "],["2099.4","translated to worship comes with this "],["2101.17","concept of literally falling with your "],["2102.79","face to the ground kissing the floor "],["2104.8","bowing before the Saviour and there's no "],["2108.04","other response that would seem so "],["2110.2","natural to do when face to face with the "],["2112.66","God of the universe that we would fall "],["2114.16","down before him now I don't mean I don't "],["2116.32","think this means that we have to have "],["2117.58","these bowing services every Sunday you "],["2119.68","know and take a time everybody go "],["2121.15","face-first you know don't bang your head "],["2124.32","but this is more about our heart "],["2127.57","condition especially that our hearts "],["2129.64","fall prostrate before the Lord that we "],["2131.89","bow before him and worship now I think "],["2134.619","if our hearts are in that condition "],["2136.51","I think that may naturally express "],["2138.369","itself and physically bowing down to the "],["2140.02","floor is an act a variation and worship "],["2142.03","to our King but I don't think we're "],["2144.22","required to do that necessarily but "],["2146.32","hopefully that gives you a better idea "],["2147.22","of what worship really looks like is a "],["2149.59","sense of humility and all "],["2151.69","reverence when coming in the presence of "],["2153.7","the Lord you know so I pray that we're "],["2155.619","coming before him in our hearts at least "],["2157.39","in humility and on reverence and not in "],["2160.02","selfishness and pride and arrogance "],["2162.43","it's about our heart condition so "],["2164.68","biblical worship is adoration alright so "],["2169.63","we've seen from this example of heavenly "],["2171.94","worship here in revelation four and five "],["2173.77","six elements of what I believe biblical "],["2176.38","worship should look like and this is "],["2177.49","stuff that we should be living out each "],["2179.44","and every day so I'm going to review it "],["2180.79","for you guys in case you missed it "],["2182.349","double Co worship is God centered the "],["2184.45","book o worship is praise double Co "],["2186.49","worship is liturgical biblical worship "],["2188.92","is focused on Christ double chorus of "],["2191.319","his music biblical worship is adoration "],["2193.93","so question remains now are you am i "],["2197.829","living out biblical worship is this part "],["2200.92","of our day-to-day life this is not just "],["2202.42","you know a Sunday only like this this is "],["2204.88","each and every day are we living in the "],["2206.47","presence of God in this sense of "],["2208.329","biblical worship are we centered on God "],["2210.46","over giving him praise in an orderly "],["2212.26","manner focusing on Christ making a "],["2214.359","joyful noise to him in adoration my "],["2217.03","prayer my hope is that you can say yes "],["2218.589","and I can say yes to all this but if not "],["2221.349","and I know oftentimes our pride and "],["2223.15","selfishness gets in the way I would "],["2224.92","encourage you and myself to pray to the "],["2227.5","Lord ask him for a heart of worship you "],["2229.569","know to work within you to make your "],["2231.31","heart to fall prostrate and bow down "],["2232.72","before him as we just saw a true worship "],["2234.819","that we come before him with this heart "],["2237.069","that is so eager to adore him to praise "],["2240.369","his name to glorify the name of Christ "],["2242.349","for he is so worthy that we would not do "],["2244.15","this in our own strength in our flesh "],["2245.319","but we would follow him and worship him "],["2247.569","as he's called us to do right so before "],["2249.88","I close I just think would be fitting to "],["2252.099","give you a definition of worship this is "],["2254.05","not one I came up with but I found this "],["2256.569","from da Carson I think he does a pretty "],["2258.88","good job of trying to concisely define "],["2263.29","this I think very big term like it's an "],["2266.26","easy thing like we cheer about worship "],["2267.46","it's like giving really concise "],["2268.66","definition is not I don't think an easy "],["2270.25","task it's kind of how things go the word "],["2273.069","worship also in our in our language you "],["2275.26","know comes from an old English word "],["2276.28","which basically comes out to worth-ship "],["2279.599","so I think of the idea that something is "],["2282.609","worth the worship if someone "],["2285.49","as worth-ship than they're worthy of "],["2286.96","that worship now obviously Christ is "],["2289.45","definitely worthy of our worship so "],["2292.36","maybe keep that in mind as you think "],["2293.8","about worship and approach this concept "],["2295.66","that it's about the work in the thing "],["2297.76","the object of the worship and whenever "],["2300.25","we worship anything other than the God "],["2301.66","the universe "],["2302.35","we're ascribing Worth to that which is "],["2304.69","not God and obviously that's idolatry "],["2306.64","and God hates that "],["2307.63","so di Carson gives us definition worship "],["2310.06","he says worship is the proper response "],["2312.79","of all moral sentient beings to God "],["2315.55","ascribing all honor and worth to their "],["2318.369","Creator God precisely because he is "],["2320.56","worthy delightfully so it's really good "],["2323.68","I'm gonna say that again because you "],["2324.76","missed it worship is the proper response "],["2326.98","of all moral sentient beings to God "],["2329.32","ascribing all honor and Worth to their "],["2331.81","Creator God precisely because he is "],["2334.06","worthy delightfully so really good and I "],["2337.3","think a key word there is proper "],["2338.89","response it is the proper response of "],["2341.32","all moral sentient beings obviously us "],["2343.9","being an example to worship God not only "],["2347.65","are we called to do so in Scripture but "],["2349.36","because of who he is and what he's done "],["2352.03","we should worship Him it is our proper "],["2354.25","response and I think 1st chronicles 16 "],["2356.83","29 shows us beautifully it says ascribe "],["2359.2","to the Lord the glory due his name bring "],["2361.93","an offering and come before him worship

"],["24.63","months ago it was decided that I would "],["27.599","be preaching today when Rob was out of "],["30.06","town and I immediately started sort of "],["33.33","formulating a few ideas on what subject "],["36.269","matter I was going to talk about and "],["38.129","almost immediately I sort of locked on "],["40.08","to this one idea that Daniel spoke and I "],["44.39","thought I would change it it was like no "],["46.86","no no we'll stick with the original plan "],["48.66","I assume the spirit moved me towards "],["50.969","this "],["51.899","so I began jotting down a couple of "],["55.35","ideas and finding some verses that "],["58.44","jumped out at me and then over the "],["60.719","course of this last month pastor he "],["63.93","pretty much used almost every verse that "],["66.3","I was planning on using and then last "],["70.259","week our guest speaker Ron Oggs he got "],["72.78","up here and used my catch there was "],["76.5","going to be at the end of the sermon "],["77.61","mine was going to be most of us would "],["79.679","say we'd be willing to die for our faith "],["81.479","and for God but how many of us would be "],["83.399","willing to live for him

thought was the inspiration "],["98.64","of the Spirit was actually a gift of "],["100.5","prophecy but you know we're going to "],["102.929","we're going to work with it a little bit

"],["77.92","about 2003 ish 2003 2004 pastor Tim for "],["82.66","you guys that remember pastor Tim was "],["84.43","still here when that was going on so me "],["88.21","growing up young and what I was always "],["90.61","taught about Jesus my mom and dad did a "],["93.85","really good job teaching me about Jesus "],["95.2","had an understanding about Jesus to me "],["97.24","what he was about me that he loved me "],["99.13","knew all that good stuff which is great "],["101.97","but the other side of me from a very "],["105.1","young age I had a lot of fish fleshly "],["108.88","desires a lot of fleshly desires things "],["112.33","that what cool things look like trouble "],["113.92","that was right up my alley "],["115.57","that was me anything it looked like "],["117.79","trouble I wanted to do it "],["120.25","I was very obsessive still I'm obsessed "],["122.47","if I have to watch that if I can grab "],["124.45","something and run with it I'm going to "],["126.37","and I'm going to drive it into the dirt "],["128.289","if and once it's in the dirt I'm going "],["130.209","to dig a hole and see how much farther I "],["131.95","can push it down in there so and then "],["134.11","I'm going to climb down in that hole and "],["135.79","stay in there with it so that's just a "],["138.099","little bit about me so roll fast-forward "],["142.78","to in the high school when I met Emily "],["145.09","my lovely wife Emily she is not here "],["148.51","she is at home with my firstborn Eevee I "],["151.03","talked a little bit about it in the "],["152.44","first service she's easy its face is "],["155.14","about this big right now she's had an "],["157.39","allergic reaction to some lotion or "],["159.01","something so his first service I said be "],["161.349","nice if she shows up don't stare at her "],["163.18","but she's not going to be here so you "],["164.739","guys don't have to worry about this so "],["167.64","so moving on so Emily my wife Emily we "],["172.209","get together and at this point in high "],["174.549","school I'm partying and doing all that "],["176.38","stuff all the craziness nonsense no "],["178.78","addictions had started yet just a lot of "],["181.03","partying and that stuff Emily did not "],["183.459","believe in Jesus at this point I did I "],["186.489","didn't think too much about it in the "],["188.319","beginning but there came a time that a "],["191.47","little incident happened and Emily so I "],["194.44","said I don't know if I believe in Jesus "],["196.329","and I was like well I don't know if I "],["198.549","can do this you know I don't know if it "],["200.17","was going to work out actually so that "],["203.23","was just a little incident and that was "],["204.7","just the time that God was always kind "],["206.92","of there even when I wanted to go run "],["208.989","away and party there would always be "],["210.22","this little thing that he was like you "],["212.17","know what will ya nope nope yep you're "],["214.63","not going to go this far I would take it "],["216.31","far but he always managed to hold on to "],["218.65","me just a little bit and I used to say I "],["220.72","would hold on to Jesus by a thread it no "],["223.63","it was him holding on to me is what I've "],["225.88","really started to realize so what starts "],["230.109","happening now is pastor Rob come to "],["232.51","church Emily gets saved praise God so "],["234.94","and that's just the beginning of this "],["236.29","awesome church pastor Rob comes and we "],["239.739","starts to understand a little more about "],["241.209","Jesus and the gospel and things like "],["243.01","that and God be the glory that Emily was "],["245.859","saved and pastor Rob was definitely "],["247.54","instrument so Emily saved the lives of "],["249.639","Jesus thank God and the life leaves in "],["251.56","Jesus we're going to get married "],["253.829","fantastic we're going through "],["255.4","pre-marriage counseling but Pastor Robin "],["257.53","Ilyana "],["258.099","I think we're 19 we got married at 19 or "],["261.76","20 I should probably figure that out so "],["264.88","we got married very young so anyhoo we "],["272.62","get married on the pastoral setting and "],["274.96","we're going through this section and "],["276.28","when you guys want to have

here is where "],["305.44","things start to get bad I at this point "],["308.95","become a full-blown addict pain till I "],["312.55","had definitely a problem with paint add "],["315.79","a pain issue but I started over taking "],["318.76","pain I'm like I said my obsessive "],["320.16","behavior I started taking pills the time "],["322.78","Edie is coming into this world I am "],["325.27","full-blown addicted to pills why she's "],["328.72","you know Emily's giving birth I'm "],["330.4","running outside of the truck doing awful "],["332.2","things coming back inside for the birth "],["334.93","of my daughter it's just awful off on "],["336.88","this full-blown attic so Edie comes into "],["339.52","this world and I'm addicted to pills so "],["343.08","bad thing so at this point I'm in church "],["346.2","I'm lying lying to everybody "],["348.37","everything's great guys is doing great "],["350.29","fantastic life is good but in real life "],["352.36","it's not it's awful I'm falling apart at "],["355.3","the team things are really really bad so "],["357.97","now we're going to move forward to "],["359.59","celebrate recovery so celebrate recovery "],["362.89","I'll never forget mr. Ted McTiernan "],["365.98","walks down the old sanctuary and he "],["369.34","comes 40 siddhaye my name is Ted "],["371.11","McCarran and I'm an alcoholic I might as "],["373.48","well and he's like and it brings up "],["376.21","celebrate recovery we're going to have "],["377.53","to celebrate recovery so some of you "],["379.27","guys will see I might find this funny "],["380.71","but he said my first instinct was I can "],["384.88","probably help with that so which is just "],["389.47","very delusional thinking very delusional "],["392.52","instead of thinking I need help I think "],["395.2","I'm probably helped those guys out they "],["397.09","need some help this guy I got it I got "],["399.43","it "],["399.88","so that was the first thought just my "],["403.18","deleted showed you how delusional I was "],["405.04","at the time my mind was so far gone it "],["407.53","was scary so I start going to CR for the "],["411.34","first year I sat there and lied the "],["413.74","first year I lied all the time I'm fine "],["416.08","and then it all come up to Ted and all "],["419.02","of a sudden you know there'll be an "],["419.77","explosion something really bad happen "],["421.81","and we're coming to them sorry this has "],["424","happened in back to Lyon and another "],["426.52","explosion and back to Lyon this went on "],["428.83","for a good year I'm sure stress Ted and "],["431.139","Norma and passed through out everybody "],["433.15","dealing with me intro stressed them out "],["434.56","a lot during this office craziness those "],["437.59","don't actually got brought in front of "],["439.03","the elders and deacons of the church "],["441.069","which was a big surprise to me I never "],["444.159","forget that day I come as in the old "],["447.22","sanctuary I come walking into church and "],["449.889","they're sitting around this table and "],["452.259","I'm like what's going on guys you're "],["454.419","hanging out all right walked in all "],["456.52","right I know is for me so they sat down "],["459.4","and they read this letter off to me like "],["461.65","you got to stop like your behavior is "],["463.569","beyond bad like this behavior is not "],["466.36","acceptable "],["467.139","and and in my delusional state I took it "],["470.169","and in the delusional delusional State I "],["472.449","was like yeah but thank God I do thank "],["475.36","God for that because this church is not "],["479.11","they were always there to love me but to "],["481.63","be like you can't do this but your "],["483.4","behaviors is not acceptable and for me "],["486.099","that's great because I'm the type that "],["487.599","needs tough love and somebody to be "],["490.599","there with me and I got that both "],["491.979","especially from Ted and pastor Rob would "],["494.44","be there to be right there to put an arm "],["496.569","around me and to be right there to be "],["497.949","like knock it off what are you doing "],["499.659","like stop this is not good behavior and "],["502.33","I needed that for me I needed that and "],["505.12","they also gave me the love and "],["506.919","encouragement always gave me that love "],["509.59","and encouragement always and that was "],["512.05","just great so we'll go so when I start "],["515.26","doing a little better with the "],["517.06","prescription pills so at this point I'm "],["519.789","sitting here and I'm like man this is "],["523.029","getting bad what can I do I need to live "],["525.88","for something else so my first thought "],["527.68","well maybe I can play baseball I can put "],["530.649","all my energy and live focus on baseball "],["532.329","or I can put it on music so I can do "],["535.089","something all these just awful thoughts "],["536.769","not about Jesus so the lightbulb moment "],["539.17","it's a thirst this is simple with up you "],["540.85","can you can list for Jesus you can live "],["542.649","for God simple a little light bulb click "],["544.54","just like that and I was like huh that's "],["546.94","a good idea "],["547.81","I like this "],["549.43","I like this idea you're smart well "],["551.44","you're smart so that was a big changing "],["556","moment for me it sounds simple that was "],["557.589","big so I've run into see I'll never "],["559.39","forget it "],["559.96","and with prescription pills when you "],["562.029","stop that stuff that's awful you go "],["563.89","through physical withdrawal you're on it "],["565.779","to the point that I was you get shaky "],["567.49","sick it's nasty so I've felt physically "],["570.97","awful but I was excited I went into CR "],["574.33","and I said hey you guys guess what I'm "],["575.83","lying to you I've you know what I mean "],["578.589","I've been sucking for a long time I've "],["580.87","been lying to you and guess what these "],["583","are my lives and this is what I've been "],["584.649","doing this is really me and you would "],["586.54","think most people be like whoa man what "],["588.91","you've been lying to it what's going "],["591.19","good boy no no I got hugged "],["594.339","I got loved all of that they were like "],["597.25","we love you we'll nice to see you "],["599.709","you know it'll be nice to see you will "],["601.149","this is great this is who you are we "],["602.47","love you thank God thank God that you're "],["605.02","seeing this thank God that God is moving "],["606.64","in your life and doing that so that was "],["609.49","the first time that I kind of started to "],["611.77","see the light of Jesus you know I've "],["613.63","seen it before I've known about Jesus "],["615.459","but really that kind of healing power "],["616.9","and this freedom that I got there was "],["619.39","just great so what started happening "],["620.68","after that after that was all these "],["622.6","wonderful people in the church from Rob "],["625.06","Munsch some of you might have known "],["626.32","before that Rob much took the time out "],["628.45","of his day once a week he would meet "],["631","with me for an hour talk to me on the "],["632.529","phone just to teach me how to be a man "],["633.94","he would talk to me on the phone just "],["636.1","help me plan schedule just to organize "],["638.77","myself which was a very very big deal it "],["641.38","helped out tremendously things like that "],["643.45","and I think about it now as an adult "],["645.01","with children and all that to take that "],["646.48","time out of the day that's a lot that "],["648.76","meant a lot to me "],["649.72","dawn Murdock I'm sure everybody he's "],["652.24","helped a million people move cars and "],["654.64","all that he's changed tires on my "],["656.65","vehicles I've broken down he's came and "],["659.2","got me or giving me things I need to go "],["661.45","pick my vehicles up to you know John "],["663.97","Harris and your firm handshakes I love "],["665.77","it I love this handshake every time I "],["668.35","come and I get that handshake I'm like "],["669.82","all right that's great so you know from "],["673.3","past Rob making me feel like an old man "],["675.22","playing basketball that's always good so "],["680.46","so I got baptized right after that I've "],["683.82","been baptized before but I remember that "],["685.589","baptism because I was excited and that "],["687.779","was a really a Holy Spirit moment I felt "],["689.88","the Holy Spirit very strong because I "],["691.44","remember being there just kind of teared "],["693.36","up and it's excited and I'm not going to "],["695.91","do anything wrong again and this is "],["697.92","exciting I love Jesus I'm going to do "],["699.69","great well it did great for like a year "],["701.73","and then it just went and went right "],["704.459","back down there you guys will see this "],["706.649","verse on my arm John 5:14 I got this "],["709.2","tattooed on myself right after I cleaned "],["711.779","up on the pills as a reminder in John "],["713.88","5:14 see I've saved you stop sinning or "],["717.18","something worse may happen and I should "],["719.97","have got this tattooed on my forehead or "],["722.67","my hand that's what my wife tells me and "],["725.04","what she was correct she was corrected "],["728.279","because I did not heed this advice at "],["729.959","all I did not heat it at all so we will "],["734.43","get too high call it event number two "],["737.25","but some reason Emily decided she wanted "],["740.13","to have more kids with me so we started "],["744.63","trying for another kids to wind up "],["745.89","having twins "],["746.55","we have beautiful healthy twins but "],["750.36","around this time what I did is I had a "],["753.029","void after I got off of my first "],["755.76","addiction I had a void there that I "],["758.85","didn't feel I didn't fill it with "],["760.529","anything and in my opinion well I think "],["762.9","this is truth you have a void in you "],["764.58","that's where Jesus goes that's where it "],["766.95","goes and if you don't put him in there "],["768.63","it's not good and I didn't put him in "],["771.18","there so we're not doing that I started "],["773.94","drinking soda drinking a little bit as "],["775.83","nothing I'm just drinking a little bit "],["777.51","no biggie so I went from that to where "],["780.39","it was just a hot mess "],["781.74","just a hot mess drinking to the point of "],["785.4","pretty much the only time I was not "],["787.62","drinking was when I was at church that "],["790.31","that was pretty much it that's if just "],["793.47","the gist of it old behaviors had started "],["796.8","up again "],["797.97","I call it sheisty behavior it's lying "],["801.209","being dishonest I had such a separate "],["803.79","life it was tearing me apart one life "],["807.209","was everything's completely fine hi guys "],["810.3","I'm okay and the other five was just oh "],["812.55","my gosh was it a man "],["813.93","I could barely keep myself together just "],["816.21","driving to work

calm going through that "],["488.02","storm because God is on the inside so "],["495.34","understand this piece is not neutral "],["501.66","it's not generic but peace is born when "],["506.32","we decide to forgive others let's talk "],["510.19","about that for a moment see I'm going to "],["511.78","step away from my notes I think I do "],["513.039","better and when I step away from my "],["514.9","notes that's why I step away from them "],["516.36","let's talk about this for a moment "],["518.789","somebody has done you some wrong and you "],["521.979","all up tight and you don't want to "],["524.14","forgive them you want to hold on to "],["525.52","grudges as we say what happens eat you "],["529.39","on the inside right do I have some head "],["532.15","knobs eats away on your inside who "],["534.16","certainly more you not them right you're "],["538.96","hurting but what does God say if you "],["541.51","want peace what does the loss prayer say "],["543.85","you forgive your debtors right so you "],["547.06","have to forgive you forgive "],["549.98","God gives you peace and there's some "],["553.31","healing and then you can minister to "],["556.31","those people and you can move on even if "],["559.28","they hold it you can move on and you can "],["561.74","feel free and have peace and joy and "],["564.98","contentment why because that's the god "],["567.98","in you not you yourself it's God who "],["570.86","makes the difference so understand this "],["574.15","that Christ has already cancelled our "],["576.83","debt and he has already let us go we "],["580.76","need to forgive others and Jesus said to "],["584.39","us to preach the gospel to the world why "],["587.35","because He shed his blood on the cross "],["591.19","okay and because he shed his blood we "],["594.56","can do that I'm going to share a jacket "],["596.72","now okay yes now Christ understand this "],["605","Christ kept his disciples in peace with "],["608.84","one another so what does that mean we "],["613.13","need to be in peace with a brethren we "],["617.06","need to be in peace with those around us "],["619.19","in the church and what did he do he left "],["622.25","them to maintain that peace so we need "],["626.63","to be at peace to you will have more "],["629.87","peace if you are in Jesus God wants you "],["633.74","to have peace with him and with all "],["635.9","humanity he became incarnate and "],["638","suffered for you and me to have peace "],["640.76","and I'm not talking peace when we get to "],["643.52","heaven I'm talking right here on earth "],["646.07","we can have peace right now however we "],["651.38","can't have this kind of peace through "],["652.94","faith in God Jesus was leaving and he "],["658.01","did not want the disciples to be comfort "],["660.62","less he wanted them to feel comfortable "],["663.73","it was his last legacy so the songs "],["668.51","matchup right remember the song peace "],["671.33","and remember his last his legacy okay "],["673.69","let us visit the disciples after Jesus "],["679.4","death for just a little bit "],["681.54","so after Jesus death where were the "],["685.15","disciples remember we said they were "],["686.5","fearful what were they doing think about "],["688.99","it for a moment what were they doing "],["690.72","okay they were hiding okay they were "],["694.21","hiding remember we ever were they were "],["696.28","in the upper room weren't they you "],["698.11","remember that they were in the upper "],["700.48","room and they were praying but in the "],["704.32","upper room remember we heard the word "],["706.57","hiding as they were in the upper room "],["708.78","remember how we do is were in the "],["710.8","windows they were all locked you're with "],["713.89","me now I got it keep it that way that's "],["716.11","what I like so all the windows and doors "],["718.3","were locked and in case you forget just "],["722.23","look up on the overhead right they were "],["725.77","locked and Jesus walked in through "],["728.47","locked doors so when doors around you "],["732.1","seem to be closed and you don't seem to "],["734.56","get through who gonna open them Jesus "],["738.39","because he is there with you he is with "],["742.42","you always it's not a death estate okay "],["747.99","Jesus is present

have ever been in Sunday school with "],["762.13","me one of the things you'll hear that I "],["764.2","say sometimes you have to fake it to "],["767.41","make it understand that from a manager "],["771.67","standpoint well pastor rob for example "],["774.43","I'm going to put him on the spot do you "],["775.93","think that every day he wants to be up "],["777.25","here and give you a good smile okay but "],["784.12","let me tell you this if he does that it "],["787.21","energizes him and it motivates you okay "],["791.02","we have learned this I teach management "],["793.69","and that's one of the things that I "],["796.72","learned and I had people who work for me "],["799.78","and work very well because there were "],["802.09","times I had a broken foot but I learned "],["804.37","to make I learned to fake it and they "],["806.71","say we love working with you and all the "],["808.87","time I'm in pain but that's the name of "],["811.87","the game so yes you gotta fake it to "],["814.06","make it "],["814.93","okay so we are we now peace he said be "],["821.47","with you okay peace be with you Jesus "],["827.5","did not want them to be living in fear "],["830.11","but in peace understand also that this "],["834.07","is a common form of benediction among "],["837.04","the Jews at that time but it is the "],["841.93","invocation of the blessings of

of "],["213.72","God in Rome called as Saints grace to "],["216.12","you and peace from God our Father and "],["217.92","the Lord Jesus Christ so we see in "],["219.64","emphasis in verse 1-7 is what the gospel "],["222.799","it was prophesied in the old and "],["224.92","revealed in the new and the Apostle Paul "],["226.72","is made a a minister of the gospel and "],["229.799","we see the message is found in verse "],["231.84","three the person of Christ he is fully "],["235.2","human right we know that born of the "],["237.799","descendant of David in verse four that "],["239.92","emphasizes the deity of Christ that he "],["242.36","was declared the Son of God by the "],["244.76","resurrection of the Dead it fully proves "],["247.64","his resurrection fully proves that Jesus "],["249.799","Christ is who he says he is he fully God "],["252.439","as well uh and then also we see like we "],["256.12","said in verse five that it's Paul's uh "],["258.919","job as the Apostle to the Gentiles to "],["261.44","declare it to the to the to the Nations "],["263.88","and we are also part of that ministry as "],["265.68","well let me go to verse 8 to13 we're "],["267.68","going to read it and then we do some "],["269","observations and come back and look at "],["270.919","it a little bit more clearly uh first I "],["273.88","thank my God through Jesus Christ for "],["275.6","you all because your faith is being "],["277.16","proclaimed throughout the whole world "],["278.84","for God whom I serve in my spirit in the "],["280.759","preaching of the Gospel of his son is my "],["282.96","witness as to how unceasingly I make "],["285.32","mention of you always in my prayer "],["287.479","making request if perhaps now At Last by "],["290.32","the will of God I may succeed in coming "],["292.639","to you for I long to see you in order "],["294.8","that I may impart some spiritual gift to "],["296.639","you that you may be established that is "],["300.16","that I may be encouraged together with "],["302.32","your with you while among you each of us "],["305.36","by the other's Faith both yours and mine "],["308.08","and I do not want you to be unaware "],["309.759","Brethren that I often I have planned to "],["311.88","come to you and have been prevented thus "],["313.84","far in order that I might attain some "],["316.88","fruit among you also even as among the "],["319.919","rest of the Gentiles so what are some "],["322.639","key observations in this verse I list "],["324.96","three here in this "],["326.52","text we see important factors of "],["328.919","discipleship "],["330.039","in this verse given by Paul firstly in "],["332.479","verse eight he says what he gives thanks "],["335.68","for them wow that's hard to do isn't it "],["338.88","some people that you don't really like "],["340.759","is there anybody that you have a hard "],["341.84","time getting along with or is it just "],["344.639","me right yeah I know uh I'm thankful "],["348.44","that on a mission team we most of our "],["350.919","relationships have gone pretty good but "],["352.759","from time to time cramp quarters right "],["354.88","and then you got the rain and you get "],["356.4","people without sleep you can maybe be a "],["358.319","little bit fussy sometimes right right "],["360.12","from time to time but but Paul gives "],["362.36","thanks for them part of discipleship "],["364.72","part of the people that God brings in "],["366.28","our lives do we give thanks for them "],["368.479","even though sometimes they don't deserve "],["370.039","it do they but yet that's Grace the next "],["373","thing that we see in this passage "],["374.28","regarding discipleship is Paul prays for "],["376.84","them often verses 9 and 10 so we see "],["381.44","that prayer is an important part of "],["383.479","discipleship as God brings people in our "],["386.199","lives we need to be praying for them and "],["389","uh we know know that as Christians "],["391.96","discipleship is not just sharing "],["394.919","knowledge with them that is a key "],["397","component of discipleship right because "],["399.36","part of that is teaching Christ says in "],["401.28","Matthew 28 right to teaching them what I "],["403.96","what that you observed so we know that "],["406.479","teaching is important but it's going "],["408.56","Beyond teaching and forming "],["410.68","relationships with people giving thanks "],["413.44","for them praying for them and also "],["416.36","encouraging them in the faith and "],["418.479","sharing your burdens and your prayer "],["420.08","requests with each other so that's uh "],["422.319","involved in forming relationships with "],["424.72","each other also we see the third thing "],["428.16","uh important factor of discipleship is "],["429.96","Paul desires to teach them the word of "],["431.96","God for spiritual growth we find that in "],["434.199","verse 11 and also in verse 13 and lastly "],["437.56","we see Paul's desire is to be encouraged "],["440.36","together by each other's Faith verse 12 "],["443.52","that's part of relationship building "],["445.12","that's why we had our prayer request "],["446.319","time earlier didn't it give you "],["447.479","encouragement you see prayer request of "],["449.68","other believers and we have praise "],["450.8","reports as well how God is working in "],["452.96","the midst of Our Lives second thing that "],["455.16","we observe from this text is we see the "],["457.84","consistent Thanksgiving and prayer life "],["459.72","of the Apostle Paul and his desire to "],["462.479","disciple these Roman Believers he uses "],["465.52","two Greek adverbs that we're going to "],["466.879","see one in verse 9 is idealpos it's "],["469.639","translated unceasingly constantly and "],["472.759","the second thing is panot which is "],["474.919","translated always ises that mean that we "],["477.28","got to be prayer in prayer 24 hours a "],["480.08","day seven days a week that's impossible "],["482.24","right you die so no no more prayer for "],["485.8","you right but yeah uh it's not that but "],["488.8","the thing is praying without ceasing "],["491.28","means to make it a consistent pattern in "],["493.919","your life you know as the Lord brings "],["496.12","people in your uh your lives and say hey "],["498.8","pray for me you know you might want to "],["500.84","stop right there and pray immediately if "],["502.479","not what's going to happen you might "],["504.08","forget you know so we don't want to do "],["506.159","that so you want to pray when when as "],["508.68","the Lord brings people and then you can "],["510.039","have a time of prayer whether you're "],["512.76","driving to work or or whatever you're it "],["515.12","just it it's important to have that uh "],["517.88","one-on-one time with God on a regular "],["519.599","basis so that's what it that's the "],["521.399","consistent prayer life of the Apostle "],["522.919","Paul lastly the third thing that we see "],["525.12","in this observation from this text we "],["527.32","have two Hina purpose Clauses Hina means "],["530.24","in order that a lot of times in your "],["531.76","Bibles it's translated in order that "],["534.399","means purpose it indicates "],["536.92","purpose here in this text it's rela to "],["539.2","into discipleship we have one in verse "],["540.76","11 and one in verse 13 so I'm going to "],["542.8","point that out as we go through these "],["544.04","verses here first I thank my God in "],["546.6","verse 8 through Jesus "],["550","Christ uh it means he continuously gives "],["553.519","thanks he continually gives thanks we "],["556.079","address our prayer requests to God the "],["557.64","father in the name of the Lord Jesus "],["559.72","Christ for you all because your faith is "],["562.839","being proclaimed throughout the whole "],["566.16","world now what does this mean here I "],["569.24","believe here that it's referring to that "],["572.36","despite their "],["574.24","technological uh they didn't have the "],["576.279","technology we have today with Facebook "],["578.2","and social media and emails and things "],["581","like that telephone but yet Believers "],["583.839","and other uh uh countries and within the "],["587.56","Roman Empire the world here is referring "],["589.519","to the the the world Empire that they "],["591.279","know the Roman Empire from Jerusalem all "],["594.72","the way to the the Philippian Church to "],["597.519","the galatian church to the thessal "],["599.92","Thessalonians those people knew about "],["602.88","the faith of the Roman Believers yet "],["604.839","because the Apostle Paul and other "],["606.8","apostles were uh bringing the message "],["609.24","and talking about the faith of these "],["611.279","Believers how their steadfastness to the "],["613.2","Lord you may say well that's kind of "],["615.32","unusual but we see this uh even in the "],["618.8","Corinthians in 2 Corinthians chapter 8 "],["621.36","and9 how Paul he talks about uh the "],["624.8","macedonians to the Corinthians how they "],["627.279","were a model of Grace giving to the "],["629.68","Jerusalem Church who were in need right "],["631.839","so it was UN I mean it wasn't uh unusual "],["634.68","that the Believers they didn't know each "],["636.32","other face to face but yet they had "],["638.639","interaction as far as like they they've "],["641.16","heard of different people in the "],["642.8","churches and things like that so we see "],["645.079","that their faith was they were known for "],["647.76","their steadfastness and their faith in "],["649.32","the Lord Jesus Christ what about you "],["651.639","what about our church are we uh known as "],["654.48","a beacon of light to the lost and and "],["656.8","are standing fast on the word of God and "],["658.639","the princip of god so let's go to the "],["661.04","next verse for God whom I serve in my "],["664.2","spirit in the preaching of the Gospel of "],["666.639","his son is my witness as to how "],["670.48","unceasingly there's the Greek word "],["673.959","means over and over again I make mention "],["677.44","of you always panto the next Greek word "],["681.6","in my prayers making request if perhaps "],["685.16","now At Last by the will of God I may "],["687.48","succeed in coming to you wow we so "],["690.32","prayer is so much an important part in "],["692.399","discipleship and it should be an "],["694","important part in our lives as "],["695.32","Christians as well if you really want to "],["697.92","study uh biblical prayers I think as "],["700.88","Christians we should pay pray biblically "],["703.16","a lot of times we we neglect the "],["706.839","spiritual aspect of the believer's lives "],["710.12","and if you look at Philippians chap 1 "],["711.959","verse 9-11 Ephesians 1:1 15-23 Paul has "],["716.6","two prayers he he prays for the "],["718.079","Ephesians and also prays for the "],["720.04","Philippians and it's wonderful to pray "],["722.04","for physical needs but a lot of times we "],["723.92","neglect our spiritual needs pray for my "],["726.48","growth pray for me I'm struggling I'm or "],["729.519","pray that I'll grow into maturity and or "],["731.839","you know that that that's the Paul "],["733.24","that's the prayer request that Paul "],["734.44","makes so let's not neglect those prayers "],["738.32","how vital it is uh pray for your "],["741.04","children pray for your grandchildren "],["743.32","pray for those not just for their "],["744.8","physical needs but for their spiritual "],["746.279","needs that God will Enlighten them as "],["748.399","they study the word of God that they'll "],["750.079","stay true to the scriptures uh so "],["752.959","obviously in this text "],["754.92","here he says but At Last by the will of "],["757.959","God I may succeed in coming to you what "],["760.399","does this mean here that uh he wants to "],["762.519","go and has Fellowship he wants to have "],["764.519","fellowship with these Believers but yet "],["767.68","God in his Sovereign plan is not "],["769.6","allowing that to happen we believe that "],["772.32","he was probably in Corinth when he was "],["774.959","writing this letter to the Romans and as "],["777.279","you know the Corinthian Church they got "],["779.44","a lot of workout cut from cut out for "],["781.639","them right so maybe uh God was still "],["784.279","using Paul I believe he was still using "],["786","Paul in Corinth uh so he was not allowed "],["788.519","yet to go to Rome God finally answers "],["792.68","Paul's request but he goes as a prisoner "],["795.8","as he appeals to Caesar in Acts chapter "],["797.839","25 verse 12 so he's he's in house AR "],["802.56","rest but yet the good news despite that "],["805.56","he's in the rented quarters in Rome "],["807.639","people those Roman Believers that he "],["809.56","wrote to In this passage they can come "],["811.959","to him and visit him and they can have "],["814.12","Fellowship together and have "],["815.839","discipleship sesss together while he's "],["817.959","in house AR rest so God does answer his "],["820.6","prayers for I long to see "],["823.8","you I have a desire to see you with a "],["826.56","purpose being here we have a heina "],["828.68","purpose Clause the first and the two in "],["831.079","our text here in order that the purpose "],["834","being why does he want to see these "],["835.8","Roman Believers I may impart some "],["839.959","spiritual gift to you well what "],["843","spiritual gift is he referring to there "],["845.519","remember he has the gift of apostle all "],["847.959","of us Believers we might not be Apostles "],["849.92","or prophets or or evangelists Pastor "],["853.079","teachers uh we know that God gives the "],["855.759","spiritual gifts to the body of Christ "],["857.48","but yet we all have a part all of us "],["859.56","have a spiritual gift Paul's spiritual "],["861.92","gift here was what to teach the word of "],["865","God to write the scriptures in inspired "],["868.079","by the holy SP spirit and he had a "],["869.759","responsibility to proclaim the gospel "],["872.36","mainly to the Gentile Nations and that "],["875.48","was his spiritual gift and here what's "],["878.88","the purpose of his spiritual gift that "],["881.12","you may be established the Greek word is "],["884.72","torizo and we're going to look at uh "],["886.759","give a background more of that as we "],["888.44","continue on in the lesson so what is it "],["890.839","what it means to be established some "],["892.8","Bible has uh sometimes it's translated "],["895.399","in other text strengthened or or uh you "],["899.12","know uh it's like you're founded you're "],["901.519","grounded in the word of God that's what "],["903.399","it means here that these Believers are "],["906.399","being taught and grounded in the word of "],["909.279","God that was his main mission that was "],["912.48","the purpose he wanted to see the Romans "],["914.68","nothing wrong with food and after "],["916.88","Fellowship softball and everything like "],["918.72","that in the Philippines we love "],["920.24","basketball right and God can use "],["922.04","basketball to to uh as an Evangelistic "],["924.639","tool and A discipleship Tool uh so if "],["927.399","you ever want to come to the Philipp and "],["930.079","uh that would be a good idea to have a "],["931.44","basketball camp those who are really "],["933.04","good but we haven't tried that yet as a "],["934.56","mission team so I'm just having a little "],["936.88","advertisement for the mission here got "],["939.279","any basketball coaches in here no but "],["941.48","anyway God can use that but the purpose "],["943.68","being is what why did Paul want to see "],["946.92","the Romans was to have discipleship to "],["950.639","teach them to train them in the "],["952.92","scriptures and he continues on to this "],["955.079","next verse "],["956.6","here that is that that I may be "],["959.6","encouraged together with you while among "],["962.6","you each of us by the others Faith both "],["966.959","yours and mine is that what we do as "],["970.72","Believers are we encouraging each other "],["972.279","in the faith so discipleship again it's "],["974.8","not just training in content but it's "],["977.24","also getting getting down and dirty with "],["980.399","the people that you're ministering with "],["981.839","got to be careful that sounds has "],["983.56","another negative meaning doesn't it but "],["985.199","I'm talking about you're getting "],["986.6","involved in their lives you are uh "],["989.48","you're you're you're sometimes weeping "],["991.36","with those who weep and rejoice with "],["993.759","those who Rejoice that's what we're do "],["995.6","as a body of Christ and it says uh and I "],["999.68","do not want you to be unaware "],["1001.8","Brethren that I often I have planned to "],["1004.519","come to you and have been prevented thus "],["1007.48","far now why would that be the case why "],["1011.079","is he he made his plans you guys ever "],["1013.92","have plans right have your plans ever "],["1016.759","not come about "],["1019.16","from time to time right maybe more than "],["1021.68","more than often right but we know that "],["1024.039","God is Sovereign and for some reason in "],["1026.36","his Sovereign uh will and plan that just "],["1029.48","hasn't happened yet uh I believe here "],["1033.12","sometimes this word kuo is a Greek word "],["1035.559","it's referring to in Acts 16:6 that they "],["1038.12","wanted to go to Asia but God the Holy "],["1041.039","Spirit forbid them to go they were "],["1043","forbidden by the Holy Spirit why is that "],["1045.439","it's not that God doesn't want Paul "],["1047.559","discipling in Asia is that he had a plan "],["1049.96","for them to go to Europe and to go to "],["1052","the Philippian Brethren there in Acts "],["1053.88","chapter 16 also we see sometimes that "],["1057.12","Satan prohibits The Works of Believers "],["1060.24","he he's the one that does it but yet we "],["1062.4","know ultimately from the story of Job "],["1064.64","who is still the boss it's God right so "],["1067.88","we know that God is still Sovereign and "],["1069.919","and Satan even has to ask permission "],["1072.2","from God in certain in situations it "],["1075.4","says here in order that that what is the "],["1077.679","purpose why does Paul want to come to "],["1079.559","them again the second thing it's it's a "],["1082.2","repetition here repetition for emphasis "],["1085.159","that I may "],["1086.64","obtain some fruit among you also even as "],["1090.559","among the rest of the Gentiles the fruit "],["1093.88","here refers to outcome or "],["1096.4","result what outcome or result that Paul "],["1099.84","wanted from these Roman Believers is "],["1101.96","that they be grounded and established in "],["1104.88","the word of God so he mentions it second "],["1107.4","two times in what two verses here so "],["1109.919","that's very important so now with the "],["1111.799","time remaining I'd like to do a little "],["1113.96","study on the concept the biblical "],["1116.36","concept of establishing "],["1118.799","Believers which is obviously related to

for opportunities "],["1427.24","that he can use you in the Teaching "],["1428.64","Ministry of others Point number "],["1431.159","three how do we establish Believers "],["1434.279","through Teaching Letter A uh I believe "],["1438.08","we should teach and ground Believers in "],["1440.44","the truth about Christ his person and "],["1444.84","his work wow this is important because "],["1448.4","there's so many different Cults out "],["1450.279","there ever since the first century day "],["1453.6","one they were battling uh the doctrine "],["1457.52","that were justified by Grace okay that "],["1460.12","were saved by grace and even today we "],["1463.08","have a lot of people a lot of Cults a "],["1465.24","lot of even other religions uh say that "],["1468.2","you must do something in order to go to "],["1469.84","heaven it's it's by works it's by a "],["1472.32","system of dos and don'ts and if you do "],["1474.96","this then yeah you might be justified or "],["1477.679","whatever but we know Galatians 2:21 if "],["1481.24","we can be justified by The Works of the "],["1483.039","law if it's through human Merit through "],["1485.24","human effort through our works then "],["1487.48","Christ died what needlessly in vain yeah "],["1491.24","so we know it's by Grace also the "],["1493.48","doctrine of the person of Christ that "],["1495.36","Jesus Christ is fully God and he's fully "],["1497.76","holy man so that's so important is to "],["1500.52","ground the people you're discipling in "],["1502.84","the truth about the doctrines about the "],["1505.039","person work of Christ as we partake in "],["1507.44","communion later on that's a good picture "],["1509.6","obviously a symbolic picture as we "],["1511.52","remember the person of Christ and the "],["1513.76","bread and the work of Christ in his "],["1515.2","blood and the uh the "],["1517.12","cup secondly we need to do what teach "],["1520.72","the scriptures especially the commands "],["1523.52","and rules of living regarding our time "],["1525.32","period for the body of Christ so uh this "],["1528","is that's the importance of studying the "],["1530.12","Bible in its context uh this weekend I "],["1533.36","taught you uh the letter CW context "],["1536.919","context context has anybody ever taken a "],["1540.08","verse out of context or just me yeah a "],["1543.12","lot of us have right everybody probably "],["1546.159","and that's okay we shouldn't do it but "],["1548.08","yet that's why we have other believers "],["1550.039","to encourage each other to teach each "],["1551.559","other right and as we grow it's like oh "],["1554","man I shouldn't have yeah maybe that was "],["1555.6","the wrong thing to say or whatever but "],["1558.64","as a Christian as we grow we must "],["1560.96","remember also to read the scriptures and "],["1563.919","study the scriptures and read it in its "],["1566.36","appropriate Biblical context that's the "],["1569.24","advantage of verse by verse teaching I'm "],["1571.159","so thankful that Pastor Rob does that "],["1572.799","here in this church doesn't he uh "],["1574.64","through 1 Samuel and some were in your "],["1576.919","Sunday school was second Samuel right so "],["1579.32","it's it's very important to do that "],["1581.279","because we won't go so far from the "],["1582.96","context and it's important to have that "],["1585.159","biblical biblically based context "],["1588.2","letter C teach and encourage the "],["1590.159","application side of the text so they can "],["1592.76","realize where they're struggling with "],["1594.08","certain sins and understand the beliefs "],["1596.2","and behaviors that are not biblical so "],["1598.679","that they can make decisions to stop "],["1600.279","believing those beliefs and believe and "],["1602.84","rely and apply the word of God in their "],["1605.52","belief system and behavior so we must "],["1607.88","teach what it means what does this verse "],["1610.48","mean right very important as you read "],["1612.919","the Bible as you study the Bible always "],["1615.64","ask yourself that question what is it "],["1617.64","does this verse mean what is what does "],["1619.6","it meant in its original context when he "],["1621.76","was speaking to these Believers and the "],["1624.039","next thing is how does this apply to me "],["1626.919","how how how am I affected by this verse "],["1629.44","you know what what is it to me all right "],["1633.44","uh so that's very important a lot of "],["1635.6","times we focus just on Behavior but "],["1637.96","everything starts here in the mind in "],["1639.44","our belief system so we must get to the "],["1641.64","root of the problem it's our attitude "],["1643","and our belief "],["1644.24","system so after going through that point "],["1646.72","number three let's look at Point number "],["1648.12","four do we have biblical examples of "],["1651.279","other believers in particular the "],["1653.32","Apostle Paul establishing Believers in "],["1655.919","the book of Acts I like to look at Acts "],["1658.08","Chapter 14 verse 14- "],["1674.6","28 I just want to look at I'm going to "],["1677.64","I'm not going to read the whole thing "],["1678.679","you can go back and read the whole thing "],["1680.519","I'm just going to point out a couple of "],["1681.96","verses due to our "],["1686.32","time all right in verse 15 he says men "],["1690.039","he's talking to um pagans right men why "],["1694.2","are you doing these things remember they "],["1695.919","went and they tried to worship Paul and "],["1698.2","Barnabas we are also men of the same "],["1700.72","nature as you preach the gospel to you "],["1702.84","that you should turn from these vain "],["1704.799","things to a living God who made the "],["1707.08","heaven and the earth and the Sea and all "],["1709.72","that is in them and then verse 16 in the "],["1712.559","generations gone by he permitted all the "],["1715.08","nations to go their own ways yet he did "],["1717.44","not leave verse 17 himself without "],["1720.2","witness and that he did good and gave "],["1722.559","you reigns from heaven in fruitful "],["1724.279","Seasons satisfying your hearts with food "],["1726.44","and "],["1727.48","gladness and so we might not have the "],["1730.64","old sermon here but what did he do when "],["1732.6","he went to lisra he started out with "],["1735","evangelism right what do we do when we "],["1737.2","go to to a new place we have to ground "],["1739.12","we have to explain the gospel remember "],["1740.919","Romans 1:16 the gospel is the power of "],["1743.399","God into salvation so always explain the "],["1746.24","person of work of Christ that Christ "],["1748.2","died for our sins he was buried and he "],["1750.2","rose from the dead and then we see look "],["1753.039","go down to verse "],["1755.12","20 but while the disciples stood around "],["1757.84","him he got up and entered the city the "],["1760.559","next day he went away with Barnabas to "],["1762.32","Derby verse 19 and 18 it talks about him "],["1765.72","being stoned what did he do that City "],["1769.399","goes he went back into listi the next "],["1771.72","day I'd goone to the hospital and take a "],["1774.44","break for a couple of days or weeks yeah "],["1777.279","maybe months or never I'm not coming "],["1779.2","back to you guys but uh yeah pretty "],["1782.679","rough now I have to be careful because "],["1784.919","I'm a family man I got small kids I have "],["1786.519","a responsibility to be safe you know and "],["1789.6","I want to be around if possible to "],["1791.6","disciple my kids later on so we have to "],["1794.24","really pray about and and listen to the "],["1796.6","Lord's leading so yeah you know we want "],["1799.12","to be safe and smart correct but at the "],["1801.84","same time we want to be bold and "],["1803.399","courageous because even in the states "],["1806.519","America's not as safe as it used to be "],["1808.84","you know and even here in Maryland right "],["1810.64","there's there's some issues going on so "],["1813.24","uh the main thing is you need to know "],["1815.559","where God Wants You his Sovereign will "],["1818.36","and plan in your life and I think "],["1820.36","obviously it was God's will for for Paul "],["1822.519","to go back into the City and and "],["1824.44","continue to do his ministry there um "],["1828","next thing we see in "],["1830.72","verse 23 when they had appointed Elders "],["1834.32","for them and every Church having prayed "],["1837.36","with fasting they commended them to the "],["1839.48","Lord in whom they had believed wow so "],["1843.76","what did he do what was the next thing "],["1846","if you remember our Char in discipleship "],["1848.679","and uh missions back on the first day "],["1852.36","what's the first step it's evangelism I "],["1854.799","believe the next step is basic "],["1856.639","discipleship ship where we're we're "],["1858.399","following up those Believers that have "],["1860.519","recently come to a saving knowledge of "],["1862.2","Christ and the third step is church "],["1864.88","planting as the Lord leads and as as "],["1867.679","they have that desire they would maybe "],["1869.679","want to start a church or you could "],["1871.559","Point them to a a good Bible teaching "],["1873.96","church right the third step and fourth "],["1877","lastly is eldership training and that's "],["1880.6","what the Apostle Paul was doing here "],["1882.639","appointed elders and they were appointed "],["1885.159","they were ready to teach and train and "],["1887.519","then after that he moves on and goes "],["1889.519","back and he continually does follow up "],["1891.08","with those "],["1892.08","Believers also our next example letter B "],["1896.12","Paul's training of the Ephesian Elders "],["1898.36","we find this in Acts chap 20 verse "],["1901.399","17-38 we already looked at this more in "],["1904.24","depth uh in our missions conference back "],["1906.88","on Friday night this was our first "],["1909.08","example so I just want to uh point out a "],["1911.48","couple of things in the verses if we "],["1913.96","look at verse 18 of chapter "],["1916.159","20 Acts chapter uh 20: "],["1924.679","18 and when they had come to him this is "],["1927.84","Paul saying goodbye to the Ephesian "],["1929.559","Elders the holy spirit is revealed to "],["1931.96","Paul that he's not going to see these "],["1933.2","Believers anymore on this side of the "],["1934.799","Earth right only in eternity so this was "],["1937.399","a really sad time here and you "],["1939.88","yourselves know from the first day that "],["1942.039","I set foot in Asia how I was with you "],["1944.799","the whole time serving the Lord with all "],["1946.84","human humility and with tears and with "],["1948.84","trials which Came Upon me through the "],["1950.399","plots of the Jews how I did not shrink "],["1953.159","from declaring to you anything that was "],["1955.639","profitable and teaching you publicly and "],["1958.6","from house to house solemnly testifying "],["1960.799","to both Jews and Greeks of repentance "],["1962.6","toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus "],["1966.48","Christ so what did Paul do of course he "],["1968.919","started with evangelism publicly and "],["1972.08","privately house to house and we know "],["1974.08","that God uses all forms of evangelism to "],["1977.12","to bring people to a saving knowledge of "],["1978.96","Christ and secondly I want you to read "],["1981.159","at verse 27 let's look at acts "],["1987.039","2027 he says in verse 27 for I did not "],["1990.44","shrink from declaring to you the whole "],["1994.24","purpose of God well what does that mean "],["1997.72","I believe that Paul in his discipleship "],["2000.519","he taught from basic theology all the "],["2003.08","way to Advanced theology he covered it "],["2005.08","all he didn't leave anything out so as "],["2008.039","Christians we need to grow in Grace grow "],["2010.96","in knowledge of Christ covering all the "],["2013.399","scripture remember all the scriptures "],["2014.84","profitable for Doctrine for teaching "],["2017.2","reprove and then as the Lord leads us "],["2019.919","and gives us opportunity teach those as "],["2021.88","well so that's very important part of "],["2025.279","discipleship nextly and lastly of this "],["2027.6","example let's go to verse "],["2032","31 therefore be on the alert remembering "],["2036","that night and day for a period of 3 "],["2039.559","years I did not cease to admonish each "],["2042.36","one of you with tears so this eldership "],["2045.159","training that Paul did with the elders "],["2047.36","was not a short process it wasn't just a "],["2049.359","one- day thing or a weekend thing but it "],["2051.8","was a thorough lengthy extensive "],["2054.159","training night and day for three years "],["2058.119","wow so we see spiritual growth is not a "],["2061.44","one- day thing is it all right I'm "],["2063.079","mature I'm ready to go don't anything "],["2064.96","else right no more training I'm done we "],["2067.32","know biblically it's a lifetime process "],["2069.96","isn't it so that's very important that "],["2072.48","we understand that and the Apostle Paul "],["2075.44","was very thorough in his training to the "],["2076.96","elders so what what is the application "],["2079.839","of this we see in point number five "],["2081.76","lastly the results of establishing "],["2086.159","Believers will our effort have any fruit "],["2090.2","will the efforts of pastors and leaders "],["2093.04","and elders missionaries will it will it "],["2096.639","really matter and I believe it does and "],["2099.16","I believe that good "],["2101.04","discipleship will lead

"],["2153.079","can't that's between them and the Lord "],["2154.8","but as we do our part and as the Lord "],["2157.119","grows these Believers as they grow into "],["2159.76","maturity this is what happens this is "],["2162.4","hopefully what's happening in our lives "],["2164.319","as well uh it produces the following "],["2168.319","based on the text the first thing is "],["2170.319","unity of the faith that where we're "],["2173.04","unified in the faith meaning that we "],["2175.76","don't compromise our theology we don't "],["2178.68","compromise on the foundation on the "],["2180.16","person and work of Christ watch out for "],["2182.04","people that says it doesn't matter we "],["2183.44","all worship the same God the Hindus the "],["2186.319","every the Buddhists

"],["448.79","servants first if you were to take a "],["452.12","look at the Constitution and read it "],["453.92","you'd quickly discover that it only does "],["456.14","two things defines the

"],["486.89","know where he got that James Madison "],["490.82","again went to those who study the Bible "],["494.56","you'll find out that the Bill of Rights "],["498.11","originates from a 13th

"],["536","order "],["538.89","and this is the limitation of authority "],["543.1","of the servants they can go no further "],["546.36","that's the line not one more step even "],["551.35","if they have the best of intentions "],["554.49","because beyond that step is left solely "],["559.99","to the discretion of the rulers let's "],["564.91","take a look at the rulers authority they "],["567.49","first asked you a question I know a pop "],["569.5","quiz on a Sunday who ever heard of that "],["572.19","but does the Constitution apply to you "],["577.11","I'd like to see a show of

"],["616.81","there's not one limitation not one "],["620.2","restriction on the people on the rulers "],["629.4","doesn't apply to you doesn't pertain to "],["632.56","you some of you might be thinking wait a "],["635.53","minute our founders crazy were they "],["639.54","anarchists happen for a bit how can this "],["643.03","be our first clue comes from John Adams "],["653.27","and there it is he said the Constitution "],["657.87","was made only for a moral and religious "],["661.23","people it is wholly inadequate to the "],["664.71","government of any other and this leads "],["670.2","us to Galatians 5 let's take a look at "],["673.35","it galatians sia five says you my "],["679.11","brothers and sisters were called to be "],["681.06","free but do not use your freedom

"],["911.37","happened to be going down the road and "],["913.35","when he saw the man passed by on the "],["916.14","other side "],["917.51","so too a Levite and most Christians "],["923.81","wrongly conclude that the priest and the "],["925.61","Levite were acting scandalously "],["927.98","hypocritical and that's the point of the "],["930.74","parable hey don't act like a hypocrite "],["936.58","but they weren't hypocrites they were "],["940.67","acting in perfect accordance with Jewish "],["943.04","law I think about it from their "],["945.95","perspective the man who fell among "],["948.44","robbers was beaten he was probably "],["950.69","bloody he was stripped you know what "],["955.48","dead men don't offer much resistance to "],["958.31","that and he was half-dead indicating he "],["962.03","was not moving he can almost hear the "],["965.9","Levite and other travelers going yeah I "],["971.72","saw that guy in the side of the road man "],["974.15","he looked d-e-a-d to me they followed "],["979.52","Levitical law hey avoid contact with the "],["982.85","dead I mean after all they were holy men "],["985.85","went from one holy city to another they "],["988.73","were supposed to stay clean then what "],["995.03","did Jesus asked who are the rulers let's "],["1001.39","continue on but a Samaritan as he "],["1004.15","traveled came where the man was and what "],["1006.46","he saw him he took pity he bandaged his "],["1008.68","wounds then put the man on his own "],["1010.36","donkey and brought him to an inn and "],["1012.58","took care of him next day he took out "],["1015.16","two denarii gave them to the innkeeper "],["1017.32","saying look after him when I return I "],["1021.52","will reimburse you for any extra expense "],["1024.28","that you may have Jesus asked who is "],["1028.42","your neighbor this is who the rulers are "],["1035.25","freedom is not the right to do whatever "],["1037.99","you want it is the

"],["1087.64","collection is three feet on my property "],["1090.67","now I know Eric to be a Galatians 5 kind "],["1095.35","of guy and so I have no doubt that when "],["1098.65","I come to Eric and

moment that I think "],["28.369","speaks directly to the times in which we "],["30.529","lived today it's also a passage that has "],["35.899","been continually reoccurring in my mind "],["38.27","in my heart past several months so John "],["41.3","chapter 6 beginning in verse 47 going to "],["45.62","jump into a kind of middle of a "],["47.989","conversation that Jesus was having with "],["50.39","the people beginning in verse 47 Jesus "],["53.989","says truly truly I say to you whoever "],["56.989","believes has eternal life I am the bread "],["59.749","of life your fathers ate

the Jews then disputed among "],["80.93","themselves saying how can this man give "],["83.119","us his flesh to eat so jesus said to "],["86.09","them truly truly I say to you unless you

that came down from heaven now as "],["119.42","the father ate and died whoever feeds on "],["122.359","this bread will live forever jesus said "],["125.329","these things in the synagogue as he "],["126.859","taught at copernum this next portion is "],["129.44","what we're really going to focus on this "],["130.64","morning when many of his disciples heard "],["133.91","it they said this is a hard as saying "],["137.03","who can listen to it Jesus knowing in "],["140.36","himself that his disciples for rumbling "],["142.22","about this said to them do you take an "],["144.8","offense at this then what if you were to "],["147.26","see the Sun "],["148.15","man ascending to where he was before is "],["150.659","it is the spirit who gives life the "],["153.189","flesh is of no avail the words that I "],["156.4","have spoken to you our spirit and life "],["158.079","but there are some of you who did not "],["160.09","believe where jesus knew who from the "],["162.519","beginning who those were who did not "],["165.22","believe and who it was who would betray "],["166.87","him and he said this is why i told you "],["169.48","that no one can come to me unless it is "],["171.519","granted him by the father for 66 this "],["175.329","was a pivotal moment after this many of "],["178.239","his disciples turned back and no longer "],["180.97","walked with with him so jesus said to "],["184.12","the twelve do you want to go away as "],["186.4","well Simon Peter answered him Lord to "],["191.049","whom shall we go you have the words of "],["193.45","eternal life and we have believed and "],["195.4","have come to know that you are the Holy "],["197.439","One of God jesus answered them that not "],["200.769","choose you 12 and yet one of you is a "],["203.139","devil you spoke of Judas the son of "],["205.299","Simon Iscariot for he one of the twelve "],["208.269","was going to betray him let's pray "],["211.98","father God I thank you for

as we as we grapple with with "],["235.269","some hard sayings pray this in Jesus "],["238","name Amen alright so if we take the book "],["241.9","of John to be chronological in order up "],["244.18","to this point of John 6 we will see that "],["247.54","Jesus has been experiencing almost "],["249.129","unparalleled success in his early "],["251.47","ministry people have been flocking to "],["253.81","him by the thousands and he's done "],["256.63","several several miracles John to Jesus "],["260.109","turned water into wine at the wedding of "],["261.76","Cana in John for jesus healed an "],["265","official's son and in John 5 can heal "],["267.639","the lame man at the Pool of Bethesda and "],["270","if you flip a couple pages back in your "],["272.56","Bible to the beginning of John 6 you'll "],["275.62","say see in the heading that just a day "],["278.229","before what we read Jesus MO "],["281.5","applied a kid's lunch of loaves and fish "],["284.38","and he fed a crowd of 5,000 and the "],["287.77","night before the immediate passage "],["289.54","before this Jesus walked on water and "],["292.65","displaying to his disciples this "],["295","incredible power Jesus had over nature "],["297.78","so it's not any wonder why Jesus is "],["300.79","attracting such crowds he was doing the "],["303.94","miraculous and everyone wanted to see "],["305.53","what he would do next Jesus at this "],["308.35","point had reached this almost celebrity "],["310.33","status he was popular and everyone "],["312.85","wanted to see if Jesus was for real word "],["315.91","of mouth of spreading people were saying "],["317.5","did you see what Jesus Jesus just did if "],["320.98","you hear about the miracles the bread "],["324.06","but Jesus suspects that earlier in "],["327.19","chapter 6 that the motivations of the "],["329.2","people may not be the purest and Jesus "],["333.01","always has a way of suspecting people's "],["335.05","motives that maybe the people weren't "],["337.72","coming to him because they were "],["339.16","believing his message or they wanted to "],["341.05","follow him to the end but maybe for more "],["343.57","immediate and temporal reasons so all "],["346.51","the way back in verse 25 backtrack "],["348.43","before the passage we read the people "],["352.78","come to him and I say rabbi when did you "],["355.57","come here and he just says this is the "],["359.02","first live very truly I tell you you're "],["360.91","looking for me not because you saw the "],["362.77","signs I performed but because you ate "],["364.99","the loaves and had your fill do not work "],["367.57","for the food that spoils but for the "],["369.61","food that endures to eternal life so "],["372.03","according to Jesus the people are coming "],["374.979","to him not because they really want to "],["376.87","follow him not because they believe he's "],["379.03","God and want to proclaim his name to the "],["381.28","world but they're coming because they "],["383.11","enjoyed a free meal on Jesus yesterday "],["384.76","and they want some more I think it's "],["387.28","funny if you think of all the cultural "],["388.96","differences between us here in America "],["391.66","2017 and the Hebrews and Jesus time "],["395.02","there's so many differences right "],["396.85","there's language there's customs there's "],["399.49","religion things were different but even "],["403","still with all those differences nothing "],["404.5","attracts a crowd like free food and I "],["407.8","think you know just ask Mike went when "],["409.419","he wants to have a fundraiser and he "],["411.58","wants to get a lot of money for the "],["412.63","youth what they do "],["415","till tacos right tacos and people come "],["417.43","we pack it out downstairs so Jesus is "],["420.31","calling out the wrong motives of the "],["421.84","people and tells them not to seek the "],["423.7","temporary not to seek the physical food "],["426.04","that spoils that stays in your stomach "],["427.87","for a couple hours and then and then "],["429.85","you're hungry again but to seek the food "],["432.13","that endures to eternal life so what is "],["435.88","this food how can we eat of this food "],["438.85","that endures to eternal life and Jesus "],["441.88","describes it in verse 29 and later in "],["444.07","verse 40 that the food is that you "],["446.08","believe on the one the father has sent "],["449.91","for the people they don't get it they "],["453.28","have their mind fixed on getting some "],["455.56","more bread out of Jesus they can only "],["457.27","understand his talk of bread in the "],["459.1","physical sense there's kind of this "],["461.2","general rule of mankind that unless "],["463.87","we're otherwise influence on us God "],["465.73","illuminates the truth to us our minds "],["468.55","are always bent and kind of fixated on "],["470.71","the temporal and the physical and these "],["472.9","and these people aren't any different so "],["475.96","in verse 33 you can see the confusion "],["478.69","can't be any more clear Jesus says the "],["482.65","red of God is the bread that comes down "],["484.36","from heaven and gives life to the world "],["486.55","in other words you're saying that that "],["488.74","Jesus he is the food that they should be "],["491.02","seeking he is the source he is the "],["492.88","sustainment necessary for real life so "],["496.27","Jesus is saying and what are the people "],["498.64","say in response and say sir give us the "],["502.66","spread always so they're not on the same "],["505.84","page this isn't the first time that we "],["508.66","see human confusion when trying to "],["510.82","discern Jesus talking about spiritual "],["513.49","realities if you guys remember John 3 "],["516.099","this is Jesus talking to Nicodemus the "],["519.159","religious leaders the Pharisee and Jesus "],["522.31","tells him very truly I tell you no one "],["525.04","can see the kingdom of God unless they "],["526.99","are born again Nicodemus maybe not the "],["529.71","brightest spiritually minded guy he says "],["532.27","how can someone be born again when they "],["534.4","are old surely they cannot enter a "],["537.04","second time into their mother's womb the "],["539.77","Jesus is talking right in a spiritual "],["541.24","sense about a spiritual rebirth and "],["543.63","Nicodemus you can't understand that he "],["546.67","thinks it's "],["547.66","school this again happens in John 4 "],["550.15","where Jesus is talking to the Samaritan "],["552.31","woman at the well in Jesus tells her if "],["555.61","you knew the gift of God and who it was "],["557.8","that asks you for a drink you'd have "],["560.17","asked him and he would have given you "],["561.4","living water because it talking about "],["563.32","satisfying her spiritual thirst right "],["565.78","just this longing she had for "],["568","fulfillment and has the woman respond "],["571.06","sir you have nothing to draw with and "],["573.49","the well is deep where can you get this "],["575.44","living water so she's thinking in this "],["577.63","physical sense Jesus is speaking about "],["580.77","satisfying a spiritual need and the "],["583.81","people here and this passage and job six "],["585.82","are no different Jesus is kind of trying "],["591.1","to communicate the spiritual truth and "],["592.66","no manner of explaining on Jesus part "],["594.91","will convince them that he's speaking in "],["596.77","this spiritual sense for the "],["599.44","conversation as you could tell starts to "],["601.03","escalate a little bit and verse 35 Jesus "],["604.63","says that he is the bread of life and "],["606.87","that whoever comes to him will never go "],["609.25","hungry and whoever believes in him will "],["611.35","never be thirsty so people start to "],["613.75","grumble that's that doesn't make sense "],["615.19","how can this man give us flesh to eat "],["618.57","and people are frustrated they're not "],["620.71","only not getting the food that they were "],["623.47","wanting but now they just heard Jesus "],["626.11","start saying some things that are kind "],["627.4","of ridiculous but it gets worse and "],["633.06","Jesus says a very hard saying in verse "],["636.07","53 as its kind of pinnacle of this "],["638.94","conversation escalates verse 53 he says "],["647.44","very truly I tell you unless you eat of "],["649.72","the Son of Man and drink his blood you "],["651.55","have no life in you whoever eats my "],["654.34","flesh and drinks my blood has eternal "],["656.53","life and I will raise them up at the "],["658.84","last day what's that Jesus i "],["664.35","understanding this in a physical sense "],["665.98","is pretty disgusting right eating human "],["668.86","flesh drinking human blood you know "],["671.4","that's that's gross that's not only "],["673.9","immoral that's that's cannibalism right "],["675.82","and that's what they understood Jesus to "],["678.61","be saying this and on hearing it "],["680.96","what are the disciples do they say this "],["683.93","is a hard teaching who can accept it I "],["687.73","understandably so if you're looking at "],["689.51","it through that lens it's just a hard "],["690.8","saying and teaches clarifies and verse "],["692.93","65 that unless the father enables him "],["695.69","plus the father illuminates we cannot "],["700.33","comprehend spiritual truth so what "],["705.26","happens verse 66 after this many of his "],["711.71","disciples turned back and no longer "],["713.57","walked with him this is a pivotal moment "],["718.07","in and it isn't just the people that are "],["720.05","leaving this isn't just the crowds that "],["721.76","had just wanted to come and see Jesus "],["723.65","this is this is disciple not the 12 but "],["725.93","these are people that I think we're "],["727.67","following Jesus maybe for some time "],["729.5","maybe they were believing some of the "],["731.48","things that Jesus had said maybe they "],["733.76","were enamored with some of the signs "],["735.74","Jesus was doing but when Jesus started "],["739.31","talking about eating human flesh that "],["742.37","was that was the line for them I mean "],["744.89","Jesus thanks for the excitement thanks "],["748.43","for the fun thanks for the miracles but "],["751.85","I can't tolerate your hard words you "],["755.27","just said about eating human flesh I'm "],["757.61","out of here how does visas respond to "],["762.44","every one leaving now it doesn't really "],["766.19","say after that Jesus doesn't give a "],["769.64","response at least recorded in John and I "],["772.73","kind of think the silence is telling it "],["774.82","if I didn't know any better I would "],["777.11","almost suspect that Jesus was trying to "],["779.03","get these people leave now that we all "],["782.24","see him change his tone and beg them to "],["784.1","stay we don't see him say hello guys if "],["786.53","you want food you know I can I can make "],["788.03","more food for you and you can come back "],["789.67","and we don't even see him like really "],["791.63","clarify his statement that you know as I "],["794.75","wasn't talking about really eating you "],["796.34","know who human flesh me crazy that's not "],["798.71","what I was meaning I'm trying I'm trying "],["800.84","to talk about you know spiritually "],["802.58","coming to me but he doesn't do any of "],["805.46","that my back he actually temptingly "],["808.1","pushes the question to the 12 to his "],["811.61","best friends you guys want to go to "],["815.65","you know one of the things I like about "],["817.7","our pastor is not here today so I can "],["819.68","just kind of not make fun of them but "],["822.53","use them as an illustration one things i "],["825.26","like about rob is that and i mean this "],["828.2","in the best way is he doesn't really "],["829.22","care what what people think and i'm a "],["832.46","little different i might be a little "],["833.75","more sensitive to criticism but Rob you "],["836.9","know you know Rob he doesn't care and I "],["838.7","often tell stories about people come "],["840.17","into his office and they'll have "],["841.31","complaints and they'll be like pastor "],["843.11","rob why did you say this I really have a "],["844.73","problem with you know this verse you "],["847.16","used or how you interpreted this and and "],["849.58","they'll have a problem with the service "],["851.57","or the music was too loud or the music "],["853.01","was too quiet or the slides were right "],["855.32","or something and Rob would just say you "],["858.47","know if you have so many problems with "],["860.12","their church you can just leave you know "],["862.85","you don't have to come here it's not "],["865.52","like we're hand cupping you to the seats "],["866.9","we're not you know making you sign a "],["868.52","contract with legal obligations that I "],["871.22","will attend faith bible church for the "],["872.9","next four years every Sunday The Doors "],["875.84","right there you can leave that's almost "],["878.69","in effect what Jesus is doing he just "],["881.15","said something that no one understands "],["882.92","and the crowds starting to go and Jesus "],["886.61","is asking his closest friends his most "],["888.62","devoted followers you guys want to go to "],["894.34","you know i love the encouraging words of "],["897.02","jesus and i love the verses that uplift

all right this is great this is "],["1502.83","wonderful but then some science comes "],["1504.69","along and says well you know that piece "],["1506.7","of rock wasn't attached to anything so "],["1509.16","how do we know it wasn't fake so you "],["1511.23","know what happened a lot of the "],["1512.88","Christians put their tail between their "],["1514.23","legs and walked away from this

this no they have not okay be "],["1554.28","careful where you get your information "],["1556.79","okay so you'll see a lot of stuff that "],["1559.53","say oh yeah Christians admit to well "],["1562.23","they might admit it to it for 30 seconds "],["1563.76","until some other Christian goes how "],["1565.47","that's stupid this this and this and all "],["1567.27","sudden that scientists

"],["1064.48","the other thing we want you to learn "],["1066.08","from the video and to think about "],["1068.24","is "],["1070","that christianity is known and accepted "],["1073.12","in southern

"],["1081.36","south of the south of the the equator i "],["1084.16","would guess that they hardly exist in "],["1086.16","all of africa anymore "],["1088.88","you "],["1089.679","you you cannot go into a village "],["1093.2","i don't believe anywhere in botswana you "],["1095.2","could not go into a village where on a "],["1097.44","sunday there's somebody who doesn't get "],["1099.84","together with people with a bible in "],["1101.52","hand and and preach from the bible "],["1104.72","you saw "],["1105.84","the government has instituted this "],["1108.48","program to to to help combat aids "],["1112.16","where "],["1113.12","they "],["1115.039","they have called all the pastors to get "],["1117.44","together in the government "],["1119.36","buildings with the government workers at "],["1121.6","7 30 every morning "],["1123.76","every september "],["1125.84","to pray and hold a service and they get "],["1128.32","up and preach about the problem of aids "],["1132.08","they they have they "],["1134.24","botswana government has realized the "],["1136.4","power and "],["1138.16","and the efficacy of calling the the "],["1140.96","religious community to help take care of "],["1143.28","problems "],["1145.039","of energizing that community "],["1148","so it looks like you know you can ask "],["1150.72","well why are you even in botswana doing "],["1152.559","mission work they should be sending "],["1154","missionaries this side "],["1156.24","but think about the other part of the "],["1157.84","video where it says okay there are five "],["1159.919","pastors and i'm one of them the other "],["1162.24","one is uh "],["1164.48","the other one is in a church and and "],["1166.72","this happens so much you have a church "],["1168.72","that uses the bible but the message that "],["1171.28","they preach "],["1172.4","is "],["1173.12","is almost anti-christian so this church "],["1176.16","uh teaches "],["1177.28","uh teaches reincarnation and they deny "],["1179.52","the resurrection "],["1180.799","so uh if if an elder in the family dies "],["1183.679","oh he'll he'll come back around his "],["1185.679","spirit will enter the body of a child "],["1188.32","that's conceived somewhere and we'll "],["1190.4","meet him again in different form "],["1192.4","and and the idea of standing before god "],["1194.88","and answering for your actions and being "],["1196.64","judged and needing salvation doesn't "],["1198.559","seem to come "],["1199.84","uh have much of a place in their "],["1201.36","theology and there are "],["1203.6","there are a lot of churches that "],["1207.12","that are so far "],["1209.6","they use the bible somehow but their "],["1212.4","message is not christian "],["1214.32","the other pastor who "],["1217.2","who has so many why so many children by "],["1220.16","so many women "],["1221.6","that we can't keep track "],["1223.44","that is true you can hardly uh "],["1226.4","enter a a a yard where somebody isn't "],["1229.76","related to this guy because he had so "],["1231.36","many children but he's just carrying on "],["1233.6","he's a he's a he's a rich he's a cattle "],["1236.4","owner uh he's an important leader and "],["1239.12","and and "],["1240.4","they accept the the expected lifestyle "],["1243.52","is uh to have a lot of women you just "],["1245.919","you just you can you have the money and "],["1248","um "],["1249.2","you have the wherewithal and so you "],["1251.28","entertain a lot of women in your life "],["1253.76","uh as you go along "],["1256.08","but "],["1256.88","this is a pastor this is a guy who's "],["1259.36","looked "],["1260.96","who's looked at as a as a christian "],["1263.2","leader "],["1264.72","other fellow is a is a um "],["1268.32","is a "],["1269.76","a political leader a "],["1271.6","part of government in in ukui "],["1274.48","and uh he has it both ways he really "],["1278","believes the bible he can preach from it "],["1279.84","he knows it pretty well "],["1281.52","but on the other hand he'll make "],["1283.039","statements that "],["1284.559","that show that he is 100 percent behind "],["1288.4","the traditional the "],["1290.96","traditional belief and traditional "],["1292.96","practice "],["1294.08","um seeking the power in this and the uh "],["1297.28","and the blessings of of your dead "],["1299.36","relatives the spirits of your dead "],["1301.36","relatives who are "],["1302.88","who are all around you "],["1307.44","seeking help from witch doctors from "],["1309.28","those who connect with these good "],["1311.84","spiritual powers to combat witchcraft "],["1314.159","and then the evil spiritual powers "],["1317.12","and the last guy is a is a witch doctor "],["1320.24","and let me just "],["1321.44","tell you about this last pastor "],["1323.76","uh "],["1325.039","we um "],["1326.96","quick story "],["1328.559","we had

"],["1564.159","seen before that he "],["1566.88","as they brought the food in and the food "],["1568.96","to the to this "],["1570.72","to the cotla to the the courthouse the "],["1573.2","open courthouse where they "],["1575.039","have trials and this is where we sat in "],["1577.44","our chairs and this is where the bahola "],["1579.2","the important people were being served "],["1581.2","and we were there "],["1582.559","and generally it's the young people and "],["1584","the women who serve "],["1586.08","but he was up at the front at the table "],["1588.24","as they put the food on and i began to "],["1590","watch and i was watching him because i "],["1592.24","knew it was an issue "],["1593.679","and um and he took "],["1596.08","he came and he got our two plates he "],["1598.96","took them up front and he dished out the "],["1601.039","food onto our plate "],["1603.36","and they brought him back to us "],["1605.36","and looking us straight in the eyes he "],["1607.279","gave it to us "],["1608.96","and in a culture where "],["1611.2","where witchcraft is so prevalent "],["1614.08","and where the form of witchcraft is "],["1616","often and it runs in people's minds they "],["1618.4","don't make a distinction but you can "],["1620.4","bury medicine in somebody's yard "],["1623.039","medicine "],["1624.559","potion whatever you want to call it you "],["1626.4","can "],["1627.12","you can come sneak in at night and put "],["1629.279","it on their walls "],["1630.88","you can put it in their food there's a "],["1632.64","certain "],["1634.24","i i've i've been told it's very common "],["1636.4","for a medicine to be put in the f food "],["1638.799","in a funeral to find out who it was who "],["1641.919","killed the person who died "],["1643.76","this is all part of this uh "],["1646.559","this this view of life "],["1649.76","which sees the evil things the bad "],["1652","things that happen in our life are the "],["1654.32","cause of of activity in the spiritual "],["1656.64","realm "],["1657.679","not what god is doing but what your dead "],["1660.32","ancestors and people are doing when the "],["1662.88","as they use witchcraft "],["1664.799","so anyway they'll they'll put this food "],["1667.52","in funeral they'll put this medicine in "],["1669.36","funeral food and it's supposed to kill "],["1671.36","the person who "],["1672.88","who caused the death of the one who died "],["1675.679","but then there there are poisons that "],["1677.76","are like toxic that from plants in the "],["1681.36","belt and um if you "],["1683.84","if you gave it to any living "],["1685.44","warm-blooded creature it would kill them "],["1687.52","like shooting them with a gun "],["1689.679","so i'm sure if jane and i have had the "],["1692.159","second kind of poison the stuff they put "],["1694.24","in everybody's food but that that day "],["1697.12","when i saw him up there i was watching "],["1699.6","him carefully to make sure he didn't use "],["1701.36","any of the third type of poison which "],["1704","would kill us "],["1705.6","and um it was it was "],["1708.32","never had have had that happen before "],["1711.84","um "],["1713.2","and uh "],["1714.48","you know you can pray for us we don't "],["1716.08","worry about this sort of thing most of "],["1717.679","the time but but as years have gone by "],["1720.24","we've got we've had to get more and more "],["1722","confrontative i mean we've been in the "],["1723.679","village for 10 years people know where "],["1726","we stand "],["1727.279","and um "],["1729.36","ignon our pastor he certainly ripped the "],["1731.679","veil off of all this "],["1734.159","and and called a spade a spade "],["1737.12","but the point is "],["1738.96","that "],["1739.919","that the "],["1740.96","the the sun people "],["1743.2","in our village that this guy is a pastor "],["1745.36","this witch doctor is a pastor and he "],["1747.12","carries on like this he's he's part of "],["1749.279","both worlds "],["1750.64","and um and so the view that they have of "],["1752.799","christianity is slurred and and soiled "],["1756.08","and "],["1756.88","and and and confuses them "],["1759.44","uh those "],["1761.12","the bakalihadi the botswana speakers "],["1763.919","they they look down on the sun they're "],["1766.559","they're the lowest of of the low "],["1768.559","socially and economically "],["1770.64","um so they're they're all the time if if "],["1773.84","they're not taking advantage

"],["1791.679","and so "],["1792.84","uh and so the the message of christ has "],["1796.48","become slurred for them and they need to "],["1798.72","hear god speak to them in a way that "],["1800.96","disassociates uh the word of god and and "],["1804.399","the lord jesus from from any of this "],["1806.48","stuff that that has been a part of their "],["1808.399","lives since they've been children "],["1811.84","so that's why it's so important that "],["1813.6","they get the bible in their own tongue "],["1816","and so the the first "],["1818.559","prayer request was that "],["1821.52","you pray that we'll make it through just "],["1823.84","have the resources the "],["1826.32","to to make it through in the desert for "],["1828.72","another three and a half years and

"],["1983.2","holy lives we have to live lives that "],["1985.6","are different from the people in the "],["1987.36","world "],["1988.48","and um "],["1990.799","you know it was popular a few years

it's just a "],["2023.36","typical commercial but it's all about "],["2026.32","you "],["2027.679","it says "],["2029.12","and this is our culture it's all about "],["2031.279","me "],["2032.799","and and this is you know our culture is "],["2035.919","so splintered now that the only person "],["2038","you can rely on is yourself "],["2040.24","the families the family is not in good "],["2042.559","shape and your colleagues "],["2045.36","the world can offer the only world the "],["2047.6","only love that the world offers is "],["2049.28","self-love "],["2050.399","they offer tolerance "],["2052.8","but but but the whole idea of tolerance "],["2055.76","as it's presented to us is a social "],["2058.159","contract and you only hear about the "],["2060.159","first part of social contract "],["2062.8","tolerance is "],["2065.2","i don't you know if you want to live "],["2066.96","that way "],["2068.399","you you can "],["2069.679","you can set up your home life "],["2071.839","however you want "],["2073.919","you can "],["2074.879","you can spend your money the way you "],["2076.48","want you can do whatever you want do "],["2078.72","that's going to "],["2079.76","ruin your health "],["2081.28","you can "],["2082.399","that's fine with me "],["2084.079","you can be my facebook friend "],["2086.8","i'll sit with you at the bar "],["2088.48","or we have good times together "],["2091.04","but the other half of that social is the "],["2093.119","social contract see this you have to see "],["2095.679","this it's not love "],["2097.44","it sort of looks like love because "],["2099.2","you're treating this person as a semi "],["2101.28","friend you're not worried you know you "],["2103.119","accept him "],["2104.88","but the important most important part of "],["2106.72","this "],["2107.839","is the the unspoken part "],["2110.24","it is you can live the way you want "],["2113.04","and and it's okay with me but don't you "],["2117.2","ever "],["2118.079","tell me how to live "],["2119.68","i'm going to live the way i want no "],["2121.44","matter what it does "],["2123.2","and this kind of tolerance is the "],["2124.96","opposite of love "],["2126.72","you can't love somebody and not care "],["2128.56","about what they do not care about what "],["2130.32","they're into not care about the harm

how it destroys love "],["2140.88","of course we have to be tolerant in the "],["2142.88","legal sense well even more so nowadays "],["2146.32","because people are are "],["2148.24","they're straying

good it's an epistle "],["179.36","which means what letter he's writing a "],["181.2","letter to the church at philippi he's "],["183.2","kind of he actually founded the church "],["185.2","um "],["186.08","in acts 16 he goes there and "],["189.36","the church is actually heavily gentile "],["191.68","um we see that when he goes there in "],["193.599","acts 16 that the um "],["196.64","the

"],["204.72","walk into the synagogue this is the "],["206.879","jewish people who already know the law i "],["208.8","can tell them the gospel but there was a "],["210.08","synagogue there heavily gentile "],["212.4","and "],["213.2","um so how's the church doing "],["216","good bad "],["217.12","you know "],["218.48","yeah doing good right yeah philippians "],["220","are doing good it's one of my favorite "],["221.04","books the bible it's pretty encouraging "],["223.68","and they're doing good they're holding "],["224.799","fast to the gospel of jesus christ "],["226.48","they're growing "],["227.76","but there is some false teaching coming "],["229.84","either there or it's coming there and "],["232.239","there are some "],["233.599","different "],["234.48","uh "],["235.44","trying to see what my words say stay "],["237.439","with it "],["238.799","but there are also some dissensions and "],["240.4","some rivalries going on as well so but "],["242.879","in the main philippians they're doing "],["244.56","good they're doing pretty good so some "],["246.4","of the key themes in philippians is "],["247.92","unity in the church "],["249.76","boldness in the face of persecution "],["252.239","pressing on "],["253.439","encouragement of the body and you can go "],["254.879","up a few slides i'll show you the map i "],["256.959","have "],["257.84","let you know where it is "],["259.759","there it is so up in the right "],["261.359","right hand corner philippi "],["263.52","is where they're located "],["265.28","and today we're trying to answer the "],["267.36","question of what it means to have all of "],["269.68","your confidence in christ "],["272.08","all your confidence in christ and what "],["274.56","did it look like for paul in the "],["275.52","philippians and what does it look like "],["277.04","for us today "],["278.24","21st century um so i'm reading "],["280.24","philippians 3 starting in verse 2 "],["282.96","going to verse 11 paul writes "],["285.6","look out for the dogs look out for the "],["287.759","evil doers look out for those who "],["289.68","mutilate the flesh "],["291.44","for we are the circumcision who worship "],["293.52","by the spirit of god and glory in christ "],["296.08","jesus and put no confidence in the flesh "],["299.199","though i myself have reason for "],["300.56","confidence in the flesh also if anyone "],["302.8","else thinks he has reason for confidence "],["304.32","in the flesh i have more all right paul "],["307.68","let's hear it circumcised on the eighth "],["309.759","day of the people of israel the tribe of "],["312.32","benjamin a hebrew of hebrews "],["314.4","as to the law of pharisee as the zeal a "],["316.88","persecutor of the church that's "],["318.72","righteousness under the law blameless "],["322.16","but whatever gain i had i counted as "],["324.4","loss for the sake of christ indeed i "],["326.88","count everything as lost because of the "],["328.88","surpassing worth "],["330.4","of knowing christ jesus my lord "],["332.639","for his sake i have suffered the loss of "],["334.72","all things and count them as rubbish "],["337.759","in order that i might gain christ and be "],["339.84","found in him "],["341.12","not having a righteousness of my own "],["342.72","that comes from the law "],["344.24","that which comes through faith in christ "],["346.96","the righteousness from god that depends "],["348.96","on faith "],["350","that i may know him in the power of his "],["351.919","resurrection and may share his "],["353.68","sufferings becoming like him in his "],["355.28","death that by any means possible i may "],["357.6","attain the resurrection of the dead "],["360.639","so the first point i want to make here "],["362.479","kind of a lot going on so the first "],["363.84","point i want to make is that having your "],["365.6","confidence in christ means a trust in "],["367.84","christ alone for salvation "],["370.16","but "],["370.96","put your hope in jesus alone for "],["372.24","salvation so in the first few verses "],["374.8","maybe you're wondering what's going on "],["376.72","uh who is paul yelling at his tone is "],["379.199","pretty pretty angry he's calling people "],["381.039","dogs he's calling people evil-doers "],["383.44","mutilators and you know i'm a laid-back "],["385.84","guy i hate it when people get riled up "],["388.16","and start name-calling that's the last "],["390.16","thing i want and paul is "],["392.16","calling these people out and he's angry "],["394.8","he's in an aggressive mode right now "],["396.319","he's just ticked off "],["397.919","and who has he ticked off at and the "],["399.52","people there are judaizers "],["401.52","and the judaizers were jews that thought "],["404","that yes okay jesus "],["405.759","is necessary for salvation jesus is good "],["408.16","but he's not enough "],["410.16","you need to be circumcised also "],["412.56","you need to obey the hebrew food laws "],["415.12","you need to follow a portion of the old "],["416.639","testament as well so they're kind of "],["418.479","retracing paul's missionary

think like why would "],["429.36","anybody want to follow the law to be "],["431.199","saved who would want to do works to earn "],["433.599","salvation if it's free "],["435.36","why would anyone want to do that but if "],["437.36","you think back to their their context "],["439.84","you remember that the law was ingrained "],["442.08","into the heads of the hebrews "],["444.319","david writes

"],["605.12","jesus has done by faith "],["607.68","and then we see paul he does a little "],["609.2","self-promotion of his own kind of like "],["610.8","me he takes out his resume he says hey

side of a mountain it's a blast "],["40.68","okay we would ride big wheels we would "],["42.84","crawl into a garbage bag and go down "],["44.92","which is fun because you can't see um "],["47.6","we'd ride "],["48.879","frisbee um Sometimes some cooking spray "],["52.28","on a snowsuit and you'd go right down "],["54.64","and it was a blast okay we had a great "],["58.28","time and even though during the winter "],["60.879","my socks pulled double duty because they "],["62.92","were also my mittens um and anyone who's "],["66.439","ever tried to throw a snowball with a "],["68.04","sock "],["69.159","Mitten knows you got hit a lot "],["73.159","um even though this was really our state "],["76.28","we always had a huge Christmas my father "],["79.479","would start

"],["95.04","realize how hard it is to hide things "],["99","like air hockey tables and bikes and "],["102.479","pingpong tables in a "],["106.079","trailer for several "],["108.88","months but my dad for all his faults he "],["112.479","knew the perfect spot to hide these "],["115.6","things and I never figured it out every "],["117.799","year he simply hid them under my "],["122.719","bed he knew this was the one spot that I "],["125.84","probably was guaranteed not to look and "],["128.239","because when I was told to clean my room "],["129.84","that's where I shoved everything there "],["131.8","was always a protective wall from what "],["133.959","was hidden behind it and I never "],["135.84","questioned why I couldn't fit so much um "],["138.84","but there was really no chance that I "],["140.28","was ever going to find anything now my "],["141.959","dad he excused these U tide excesses "],["146.28","saying that it made him feel like one of "],["148.84","the three kings

by "],["183.72","the way what I intended to write is "],["185.56","nothing what came out on the page so uh "],["188.239","I had to really think about what it is "],["190.319","that we today need to learn about this "],["193.599","season that has come upon us what is it "],["196.28","that we can learn that we don't already "],["198.44","know because I'm sure most of us already "],["200.799","know the Christmas story if you ever saw "],["203","it's a Christmas Charlie Brown lus R "],["205.36","this very thing um and we have it "],["208.68","here "],["211.599","from Luke Chapter 2 in those days

not um and all went to be "],["232.239","registered each to his own town also "],["235.239","Joseph went up From Galilee from the "],["237.2","town of Nazareth to Judea to the city of "],["239.84","David which is called Bethlehem because "],["241.76","he was of the house and lineage of David "],["243.879","to be registered with Mary his betroth "],["246.12","who was with child and while they were "],["248.599","there the time came for her to give "],["250.72","birth and she gave birth to her "],["252.56","firstborn son and wrapped him in "],["254.519","swaddling cloths and laid him in a "],["256.199","Manger because there was no place for "],["258.239","them in the in and in the same region "],["261.52","cinus there were shepherds out in the "],["263.72","field keeping watch over their flock by "],["265.919","night and an angel of the Lord appeared "],["268.08","to them and the glory of the Lord shown "],["270.039","around them and they were filled with "],["271.84","great fear and the angel said to them "],["274.88","fear not which is the equivalent of "],["277.36","saying don't get "],["279.479","goosebumps it's going to happen but he "],["281.759","says fear not for behold I bring you "],["284.12","good news of great joy that will be for "],["286.44","all the people for unto you is Born This "],["289.08","Day in the city of David

suddenly there was with the Angel a "],["300.039","multitude of the Heavenly Host praising "],["301.96","God and saying glory to God in the "],["304.199","highest and on Earth peace among those "],["306.639","with whom he is pleased when the angels "],["309.08","went away from them into heaven the "],["311","Shepherds said to one another let us go "],["313.199","over to Bethlehem and see this thing "],["314.919","that has happened which the Lord has "],["316.72","made known to us and they went with "],["318.88","haste and found Mary and Joseph and the "],["320.72","baby lying in a

"],["329.639","Shepherds told them but Mary treasured "],["332.639","up all these things pondering them in "],["334.84","her heart and the Shepherds returned "],["337.24","glorifying and praising God for all they "],["339.479","had heard and seen as it had been told "],["342.16","them and at the end of eight days when "],["344.759","he was circumcised he was called Jesus "],["347.28","the name given by the angel before he "],["350.24","was conceived in the womb okay that's "],["352.72","the story and I don't want to seem to be "],["356.039","dismissive about this that's not my "],["357.759","intent because this is vitally important "],["359.759","this is the Christmas story but we all "],["362.24","know that we've all heard that before "],["365.599","right I'm hoping we've all heard that "],["368.36","before because if we haven't the rest of "],["371.08","what I "],["372.12","say okay um if you haven't heard that "],["376.8","before you're still okay just pay "],["379.319","attention don't mind the squirrels "],["382.039","outside um and and you'll be couple "],["385.039","people look all right just "],["387.44","checking now this is very often where a "],["389.96","Christmas sermon will end some happy "],["391.84","thing will be said and and all of that "],["394","but I got to thinking because it's what "],["396.639","I "],["397.8","do why a "],["400.639","baby why "],["402.96","obscurity why of all people "],["406.68","Shepherds why not if this was truly "],["409.36","going to be the king the Messiah why not "],["413.039","in a castle why not the son of an "],["415.12","Earthly King who had lots of powers why "],["417.72","not born with huge muscles and strength "],["421.16","it's a miracle birth ladies it'll be "],["422.879","okay so with big muscles and everything "],["425.879","and the baby comes out H and everyone "],["429.16","would know right away and I mean "],["431.639","everybody that he has arrived and the "],["434.44","time has "],["435.759","come why "],["438","not I hear people today all the time say "],["441.08","well if God would show up here and I "],["443","could see him than I'd believe Let's "],["445.759","test that theory God showed up in a "],["447.24","Manger people saw him they didn't "],["448.879","believe "],["451.52","okay why because it's not what they "],["455.24","expected actually probably it's not what "],["458.52","they expected and there in lies one of "],["460.039","the points Peter he expected something "],["463.36","different he expected a conquering "],["465.08","Messiah would help who would you know "],["466.639","help him Lop ears off and stuff like "],["468.56","that but that's not what happened that's "],["472.159","not what God "],["473.4","chose but my question is why "],["478.319","not I got to give a little background "],["481.159","here before coming to Christ now most of "],["484.96","the kids have heard this and so I "],["486.44","apologize to them and many of you have "],["488.159","heard this heard my testimony some of "],["489.96","you don't but anyway before coming to "],["492.039","Christ I was what is called an agnostic "],["494.96","and the agnostic is a person who holds "],["498.199","that the existence of the ultimate cause "],["500.28","of everything such as God and the "],["501.8","essential nature of these things are "],["503.4","unknown and unknowable and that human "],["506.44","knowledge is limited only to exper thank "],["509.84","you dictionary.com for that pompous and "],["512.039","arrogant sounding "],["514.88","definition that philosophy is basically "],["518.08","essentially based on the arrogant and "],["520.039","pompous philosophy that I don't know and "],["523.039","I'm smarter than you so I know you don't "],["525.399","know "],["526.64","either that's what that "],["529.76","means well I was attending Columbia "],["532.12","University in New York yes that one no I "],["535.88","did not meet our president at that "],["538.2","time um but I very quickly became what "],["541.24","is called a theistic agnostic where an "],["543.24","agnostic theist whichever um which "],["546.88","simply means I still don't know but what "],["548.72","I do know based on empirical data simple "],["550.959","logic basic mathematics and laws of "],["552.76","probability is that all of this ain't an "],["555.8","accident someone or something with an "],["558.88","intelligence caused all of this "],["562.16","though I don't know who and neither do "],["564.959","you and that's it so there's still the "],["568","arrogance in there "],["570.68","so essentially My Philosophy became "],["573","question "],["575.72","everything if and that Philosophy by the "],["579.56","way would get me thrown out of Columbia "],["581.959","um which is a Bastion of free thought "],["583.56","and Higher Learning so long as you "],["584.88","freely think and learn the way they want "],["586.839","you to think and learn "],["589.56","um but I was not willing to blindly "],["593.399","accept their teaching without proof I "],["596.16","was not willing to do that and so I "],["598.04","asked questions and eventually "],["599.079","eventually I asked myself right out of "],["601","there um but if it isn't logical if it "],["605.16","doesn't seem rational I question it and "],["608.399","the thought occurred to me um many times "],["612.68","in the past is that perhaps God coming "],["616.079","as a baby isn't logical and isn't "],["619.399","rational I mean it doesn't make sense "],["621.519","there has to be a rationale why a baby "],["624.36","who grows up to be a humble man who goes "],["627","and suffers a brutal death why not what "],["629.959","Peter expected why not what Skeptics of "],["632.399","today would expect from the creator of "],["634.56","the universe why why why why why why why "],["636.8","why "],["638.76","why well in the end what I came to "],["641.72","realize is that it's simply because "],["644.16","that's not God's plan and it never was "],["646.88","and God what I've learned over the years "],["649.6","is a lot smarter than "],["652.639","me right the first Advent of Christ the "],["656.6","first coming of the Messiah had to be "],["659.24","something different than what Peter "],["660.72","expected than what Skeptics expect why "],["663.6","do I say that well it appears that what "],["666.04","people are asking for when wishing to "],["668.16","see God to see this King what Peter "],["670.68","seemed to have wanted in his version of "],["672.48","Messiah is how Jesus will come at the "],["676.16","second Advent he will come as a ruling "],["678.8","king and a

second Advent because it'd be "],["692.959","over we would not be "],["695.48","thrilled Jeremiah tells us of his coming "],["698.36","like this chapter 23 starting at verse 5 "],["701.839","of Jeremiah says behold the days are "],["705.12","coming declares the Lord when I will "],["707.88","raise up for David A righteous branch "],["710.68","and he shall reign as king and deal "],["713","wisely and Peter at this point is "],["714.76","probably thinking yeah that's great "],["716.48","that's exactly what I want scap's like "],["718.32","yes that makesense sense but he shall "],["720.6","execute Justice and righteousness in the "],["725.24","land none of us are righteous in his "],["728.56","days Judah will be saved and Israel will "],["730.44","deal securely oh Peter's

"],["1235.559","with us as it does with him God knows "],["1240.44","and always has known the best way to "],["1243.2","reach us he understands human psychology "],["1246.96","and he understands "],["1248.84","us I think to illustrate this and answer "],["1251.52","this question of of why the child uh I'm "],["1254.4","reminded of a story that I read about a "],["1256.24","long time ago Paul Harvey um anyone "],["1260.24","remember Paul Harvey and listen to Paul "],["1262.28","Harvey or if not Paul Harvey Paul Harvey "],["1265.159","Jr sounded exactly like Paul I didn't "],["1268.44","even know Paul Harvey died and his son "],["1270","took over I was like wow that guy's old "],["1272.279","no they sound exactly alike um but "],["1276.559","anyway again I digress I used to I used "],["1279.6","to love listening to him and uh and his "],["1283.52","son well anyway Paul Harvey once told a "],["1287.039","parable again that I think really "],["1289.799","illustrates this and answers this "],["1291.2","question Parable is about a skeptic who "],["1294.12","worked as a "],["1295.36","farmer well one extremely cold blustery "],["1298.84","Winter's "],["1300.12","Night a storm had swept in almost "],["1303.039","unexpectedly dump tons of snow the man "],["1306.559","heard a strange irregular thumping sound "],["1309.159","against the storm door in his kitchen so "],["1311.6","he went to a window to look out see what "],["1314.08","it was and he watched as this group of "],["1316.72","tiny shivering sparrows apparently "],["1319.84","attracted to the light and the evident "],["1321.6","warmth inside just beat against the "],["1324.48","glass in "],["1326.159","vain well feeling a little bit "],["1328.12","empathetic and feeling a little bit of "],["1329.84","compassion on these poor miserable "],["1331.76","little beasts um the farmer bundled "],["1336.12","up layed up It's always important to lay "],["1339","up and he trudged through this deep "],["1342","fresh snow to open his barn door for the "],["1345.84","cute little struggling Birds he turned "],["1348.159","the lights he tossed some hay in a "],["1349.72","corner threw some hay on the floor for "],["1351.52","the birds to Cozy up in but the sparrows "],["1354.52","who had of course scattered when he "],["1357.279","appeared from the house just hid in the "],["1360","distance in the in the dark and in the "],["1362.279","shadows all around the farm "],["1366.48","afraid now the man he tried several "],["1369.279","different tactics to lure the birds to "],["1371.039","the barn he tried you know circling "],["1373.159","Behind the B birds and driving them "],["1375.24","towards a b if anyone's everever tried "],["1376.679","to drive birds that way you know happens "],["1378.039","they fly up in the air and go behind you "],["1379.76","and so you have to do it again then they "],["1382.4","go farther and he realized quickly well "],["1384.799","this isn't working so next he decided he "],["1387.52","took some saltine crackers and made a "],["1389.96","little Trail you know Hansel and gredle "],["1392.039","style to the barn and that didn't work "],["1395.44","uh so he went in the barn and made some "],["1398.559","bird noises and that didn't work um "],["1401.679","maybe wrong language I don't know birds "],["1403.6","have different languages so anyway "],["1406.279","nothing was working "],["1408.76","he this huge alien "],["1412.32","creature simply terrified them the birds "],["1416.76","simply couldn't comprehend that the "],["1419.48","farmer was actually trying to "],["1422.799","help so the farmer withdrew to his house "],["1426.48","and he watched these doomed sparrows "],["1428.799","from the window hoping that they would "],["1431.159","follow his Cracker Trail but deep down "],["1434.36","knowing that they would probably simply "],["1436.36","die from the coldness night that had "],["1438.4","swept in on "],["1440.559","them the night that was increasingly "],["1443.279","becoming colder seemingly by the minute "],["1446.6","and as he watched a thought hit him kind "],["1449.44","of like lightning on a nice blue "],["1452.159","cloudless day he thought if only I could "],["1455.72","become a bird if I could become a "],["1458.24","sparrow if I could become one of them "],["1460.2","just for a moment then I probably "],["1462.76","wouldn't frighten them so much I could "],["1465.039","show them the way to warmth and safety "],["1467.44","and then maybe just maybe some of them "],["1470.64","would follow me in and "],["1474.36","live and that's when it hit "],["1477.08","him that's why Jesus was "],["1480.24","born that's why we have "],["1483.24","Christmas you see to the birds this "],["1485.279","farmer appeared to be a huge fearsome "],["1488.159","creature that they did not understand "],["1491.08","they responded with fear and so they hid "],["1494.44","and they didn't follow him to safety the "],["1496.84","promise was there "],["1498.64","the safety and the warmth were there and "],["1501.039","they were in plain view they could see "],["1504.279","it but as the farmer presented it as the "],["1507.279","farmer presented himself they weren't "],["1509.679","even curious as to his intentions and "],["1512.44","they certainly weren't going to hang "],["1514","around to find out what his intentions "],["1516.24","were after he went back inside back to "],["1519.2","his home from whence he "],["1523.279","came to watch from afar they would wait "],["1526.32","in the shadows of the trees and they "],["1528.36","would die in the cold hungry and "],["1534.48","shivering and this would be "],["1538.48","us this skeptic farmer figured this out "],["1543.159","from simple observation don't you think "],["1545.52","that the god of the universe in all his "],["1547.72","wisdom and all his power and All His "],["1550","glory and holy sovereignty knows "],["1553.08","knows not has discovered knows how we "],["1556.44","would react where he to come on a

"],["221.84","right well the reason the reality of "],["224.799","what all that culminated is we're put on "],["226.84","this Earth for a short period for two "],["229.08","things to know God more intimately and "],["231.319","to know him right to study his word to "],["233.4","be about the the personal relationship "],["235.599","that we have with him secondly to make "],["237.76","him known that's it and and if if we're "],["241","just learning about God and growing in "],["242.84","our walk with him that's great but if "],["245.04","we're not doing the second half making "],["246.439","him known you're only going to grow so "],["247.879","far because Jesus Christ is about making "],["249.799","himself known to the world to the "],["251.879","Nations to your neighbor so I want to "],["254.12","take a look at some of these things this "],["255.36","morning with you and show you my passion "],["257.32","that has grown over the years next slide "],["259.68","please

very well-known passage "],["292","about the Great Commission and uh I'll "],["295.52","read it to you here it says Jesus was "],["298","going through all the cities and villes "],["299.96","teaching in their synagogues and "],["301.479","proclaiming the gospel and the kingdom "],["303.32","and healing every kind of disease and "],["305.36","sickness that the people had pause there "],["308.36","for a moment do you do you believe with "],["310.44","me today that is Jesus still going "],["312.36","Village to Village Healing The Sick "],["314.32","declaring the gospel he is but he's "],["316.759","appointed us to be the hands and feet "],["318.639","that he left us to do that task verse 36 "],["322.28","seeing the people he felt compassion for "],["324.56","them because they were distressed and "],["325.919","dispirited like a sheep without a "],["327.84","Shepherd then he said to the disciples "],["330.36","the Harvest is plentiful but the workers "],["332.919","are few therefore pray the Lord of the "],["335.8","Harvest says send out workers into his "],["338","Harvest field now I don't claim to be a "],["341.36","scholar but i' I've looked at this "],["342.72","passage and I had some friends talk to "],["344.24","me about some things the word there pray "],["346.68","the Lord of the Harvest what does the "],["347.96","word pray in the Greek language means "],["350.319","beg it literally means beg so you can "],["352.319","say beg the lord of the Harvest and then "],["353.68","later on to send out workers the word "],["356","send out means Thrust out so read that "],["358.319","passage you know Jesus now talking beg "],["361.6","the lord of the Harvest to thrust out "],["363.199","workers into his field for The Ripe with "],["365.96","Harvest and if he had that kind of "],["367.759","passion and that back then you know how "],["370.52","much so more now he left us the task and "],["373.16","it's not like it's it's changed and I'm "],["374.639","going to show you some of that so as we "],["376.24","look at the Lost World in the next "],["377.56","following slides think about this "],["379.68","passage and think

the Jerusalem "],["242.159","that is today at least the old section "],["245.06","dates back uh to the time of Joshua uh "],["250.2","back as earlier as early as 1400 BC "],["255.599","and then of course 400 years after that "],["257.94","David uh "],["261.18","reigned as King in Jerusalem "],["264.36","over the tribes and uh he made Jerusalem "],["267.78","the center "],["269.1","of his kingdom "],["270.78","and it became known as the city of David "],["273.78","as we see a portion of the old city here "],["276.96","to the right of the screen uh still "],["279.9","enclosed by the ancient city walls "],["285.54","one day as we were walking Within These "],["287.82","Walls "],["289.62","our Israeli guy took us Underground "],["293.4","beneath the mount where herod's Temple "],["296.66","once stood in the time of Jesus "],["300.78","and here you will see our guide Tito "],["303.12","he's looking at what appears to be just "],["306.12","a big block wall "],["308.4","and what you see here he is explaining "],["312.54","the Amazing Story of this huge carved "],["315.54","foundation stone "],["317.82","this stone is at Bedrock level "],["320.58","sitting under the Temple mount "],["322.979","it is the largest foundation stone yet "],["325.979","to be excavated under the Temple mount "],["329.22","it weighs an estimated 500 metric tons "],["334.139","that's equal to 1 million one hundred "],["338.4","and twenty thousand pounds "],["341.18","One Foundation Stone how did they get it "],["345.66","there Heritage workers no one real how "],["348.479","did they build the pyramids they still "],["350.639","don't know "],["352.38","how just the Manpower and and and the "],["355.86","tools that they were able to make at "],["357.539","that time couldn't move such huge spoons "],["361.139","and then as we walked the streets of the "],["363.419","old city there was a sense of security "],["366.3","but the presence of armed guards with "],["369.06","their M16s or whatever they had "],["371.84","betrayed that that sense of security was "],["375","a false sense of security "],["377.759","and as you look at these two uh can you "],["380.34","guess by chance which one is the George "],["382.979","Clooney look alike "],["386.039","you're going to hurt my feelings "],["387.3","laughing like that "],["390.84","well anyhow Jews and Muslims Christians "],["393.84","seem to be living relative "],["396.06","peaceful uh lives together and and you "],["399.78","see the the mingling as we walk up the "],["402.96","market area of the Via Dolorosa "],["408.06","the night skyline of the old city is "],["411.539","beautiful with the Dome of rock there in "],["413.4","the center shining like a gold nugget "],["415.199","and and yet it is very dark spiritually "],["418.259","the spiritual darkness of the old city "],["420.12","was driven home to me when I had "],["421.979","approached the Western Wall of Old "],["425.639","Jerusalem and that's the Wailing Wall of "],["428.58","course and uh it is the only wall Still "],["431.699","Standing uh the the only portion of the "],["434.58","wall of the Temple Mount still standing "],["436.5","and this is where uh Jews Christians "],["440.34","alike go to pray you've got to go there "],["443.28","when you visit Jerusalem but as I was "],["445.38","standing there and and just touching the "],["447.84","wall just still pinching myself as well "],["450.24","uh am I really here and "],["453.3","a a Orthodox Jewish man approached me in "],["457.5","his Jewish Garb and and he asked me if I "],["461.94","would like for him to pray for me and my "],["465","family "],["465.84","and I say well "],["467.58","he cut me off guard but I said sure sure "],["470.34","so we bowed her heads and prayed and "],["473.46","and the spiritual Darkness just hit me "],["475.979","in the face when after he prayed he "],["478.139","opened up his hand "],["479.46","toward me and there was a dollar bill "],["481.38","there and I realized what he wanted was "],["483.72","another dollar bill from another tourist "],["485.639","because he had prayed for me so the "],["489.12","spiritual darkness in Old Jerusalem is "],["492.479","very real there "],["495.24","and Beyond The Old City walls a big "],["498","modern and busy Metropolis has spread "],["501","out toward the west this is the modern "],["503.58","Jerusalem "],["505.259","and it has inhabitants of well over one "],["508.5","million people "],["510.3","it's a city of wealth of Technology of "],["514.02","high-rise apartment buildings business "],["516.36","buildings it's a city which has tried "],["518.88","and rejected Starbucks coffee can you "],["522.36","imagine that "],["523.62","it just is not strong enough which I "],["526.68","cannot understand "],["529.44","like the old city the new section of the "],["531.899","city can also give the false impression "],["534.18","that its inhabitants are living in "],["537.18","peaceful coexistence "],["539.76","for example one night as we were "],["541.44","shopping in the busy Ben Yehuda shopping "],["545.76","center area "],["547.98","a lady "],["549.48","had put her large harp "],["552.3","right out in the middle of the mezzanine "],["554.88","there and she had rolled it there with "],["556.74","you see the the hand cart and she's kind "],["559.44","of wrapped in a blanket but she was "],["561.06","peacefully playing this harp and I was "],["563.459","just standing there enjoying that "],["565.86","and a lot of people around but then I "],["569.22","learned a bit later that that lady "],["572.88","was only like a block or two away from a "],["576.839","Pizza Hut some of you will remember "],["578.6","saboro's Pizza Hut where a terrorist "],["581.459","bomber had gone in and blown himself up "],["584.58","a year or two before this took place and "],["588.12","blew up a lot of people with him so that "],["590.82","sense of "],["591.959","small security you know it is always "],["595.2","there and always will be "],["597.899","until the Prince of Peace comes "],["601.14","and "],["603.779","this uh city of Jerusalem gives the "],["606.3","false impression that it is a strong "],["609.24","City almost as if it's a fortress "],["612.44","especially because all of its buildings "],["614.88","must be built with a special stone or at "],["617.58","least the facade must have this what "],["619.56","they call Jerusalem Stone "],["621.779","it's a limestone that "],["624.24","since ancient times have been has been "],["627.92","queried there in the invarians of "],["630.959","Jerusalem and when the British turned "],["633.54","over that "],["635.42","state to Israel back in 1948 and it "],["639.42","gained its statehood the British "],["641.339","mandated that all of the buildings be "],["643.56","built with or at least be uh facade with "],["646.8","this Jerusalem Stone "],["649.68","and so "],["651.36","when the the sun is shining uh on "],["656.22","Jerusalem as you see here either sunrise "],["659.459","or Sunset that cream-colored Stone just "],["664.079","uh kind of glows "],["666.54","in the sunset and with the beautiful "],["669.24","golden heel about it and so the name "],["672.68","Jerusalem the golden "],["675.54","what I have shared with you so far is is "],["677.88","just a glimpse of the Jerusalem that is "],["680.579","but what about the Jerusalem that is to "],["683.579","come "],["684.72","now just as we've had a look uh into "],["687.12","God's word for the origin of the origin "],["690.24","of the old Jerusalem we have to look "],["691.74","into God's word too for the origin of "],["694.98","the Jerusalem that is to come "],["697.98","and of course none of us have seen that "],["700.019","Jerusalem yet "],["701.64","um with the exception of of one man and "],["704.16","that's the Apostle John and he's the one "],["707.399","who penned the last two uh chapters in "],["710.339","the Bible that book of Revelation where "],["712.38","he describes the New Jerusalem which he "],["715.26","saw "],["716.04","and uh "],["718.74","let's read from John's description if "],["721.68","you'll turn with me I'm reading from the "],["724.079","NIV and that's I think the "],["726.6","uh version of the Pew Bible in front of "],["729.6","you if you uh forgot your Bible this "],["732.24","morning but "],["733.5","in chapter 21 "],["741","now hold your finger there and I just "],["743.459","want to bring us up to date as to uh "],["746.22","very quickly the main events that are "],["748.86","yet to take place "],["750.54","uh before this takes place before "],["754.26","chapter 21 takes place the next great "],["757.14","prophetic event I believe according to "],["759.36","the word of God is going to be the "],["760.86","Rapture of the church which is when the "],["763.32","church Saints from Pentecost until the "],["766.56","Rapture uh have lived many have died "],["770.7","some will still be living when Jesus "],["772.98","returns uh in the sky and he will "],["776.339","Rapture the church he will take the way "],["778.44","take away the church uh into heaven "],["782.3","forever to be with him "],["784.8","after the Rapture there will be a seven "],["788.16","year period upon this earth called the "],["791.76","tribulation period the first half of "],["794.579","that tribulation period the Antichrist "],["796.62","will arise "],["798.36","the second half of that tribulation "],["800.16","period it is going to uh be hell on "],["803.399","Earth because that is where all the "],["806.279","judgments of Revelation that you would "],["808.26","read in the earlier chapters of "],["809.94","Revelation rained down upon this Earth "],["812.399","as God judged judges this ungodly world "],["816.36","and through that judgment seeks to bring "],["819.24","more people to Faith in the Messiah "],["822.24","Jesus Christ it's particularly a time of "],["825.959","judgment for Israel who at the end of "],["829.079","that seven

they refuse to do at his first "],["846.12","coming "],["846.959","Jesus then will establish his kingdom "],["850.2","upon Earth the millennial Kingdom the "],["852.6","one thousand year Kingdom he will reign "],["854.88","upon Earth as king of kings and Lord of "],["857.1","lords at the beginning of that Temple "],["859.339","the new Temple of Jerusalem will be "],["863.399","built as described

during which Satan will have been "],["878.22","bound in the abyss he will be loose for "],["882.06","a final struggle "],["884.22","and that final struggle result in his "],["886.86","total defeat and all of the Heathen "],["889.32","armies of the world who who over those "],["891.959","thousand years will have begun to once "],["894.72","again try to come against Christ they "],["896.94","will be destroyed "],["898.74","cast into the Lake of Fire "],["901.38","then will be the great white Throne "],["904.8","Judgment at which time all unbelievers "],["908.04","will stand before God in

"],["922.5","Earth will create a new Heaven A New "],["926.1","Earth and a New Jerusalem "],["929.699","amen "],["931.44","and those of us "],["934.5","who have loved him as our Savior and "],["937.44","Lord will live and reign with him "],["940.32","forever and ever that's just a bird's "],["943.56","eye view of a lot that is going to "],["946.199","happen in the years ahead "],["949.139","so let's join the Apostle John as he was "],["951.3","receiving these Revelations from God "],["953.399","about the New Jerusalem while he was "],["955.8","exiled on the island of Patmos in the "],["958.199","first century "],["959.459","we joined the uh we joined John as as an "],["962.88","angel is showing him the holy city "],["965.16","reading verses one and two of chapter "],["967.38","21. then I saw a new Heaven and a new "],["970.199","Earth for the first "],["972.54","away "],["974.1","and there was no longer any "],["976.68","I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem "],["980.04","coming down out of Heaven from God "],["983","prepared as a bride beautifully dressed "],["986.339","for her husband "],["992.22","I believe this city which John Saul in "],["994.56","in this Vision uh "],["997.079","in the past "],["998.759","is going to be a a literal Hands-On City "],["1003.98","in the future "],["1007.279","I think there is no good reason to "],["1009.079","believe otherwise "],["1010.88","as we get a little further into this "],["1013.459","we're going to see that this city is "],["1015.139","described in great detail if it was an "],["1018.38","imaginary City that wouldn't be true "],["1021.259","but it's described as a literal City "],["1023.66","also Dr Alcorn who wrote a book entitled "],["1027.559","Heaven said this "],["1030.38","after all where do we expect "],["1034.1","physically resurrected people to live if "],["1038.299","not in a physical environment "],["1042.14","common sense "],["1043.88","I believe also that in the New Jerusalem "],["1045.98","in the new Earth that are the main "],["1047.839","components "],["1049.96","uh making up the new heaven that uh "],["1054.799","the new heaven will will consist more of "],["1058.16","more than of more than just the the New "],["1061.46","Jerusalem and the new Earth but I think "],["1064.28","those two components will make up uh "],["1067.28","primarily the new heaven "],["1071.12","what was the first thing to catch John's "],["1073.4","attention here "],["1076.64","I wonder if it was a statement in verse "],["1078.559","1 that we read "],["1080.48","there was no longer any seed "],["1083.9","you know I have to admit when I read "],["1085.58","that I get a little say it because I "],["1086.96","like to see "],["1088.039","I like the water I was just down along "],["1089.6","the the water here the other day with my "],["1091.64","daughter catching fish and we're not "],["1093.02","going to tell you where

"],["1126.94","geography teacher somebody told me uh "],["1130.7","and so it "],["1132.4","has to a large degree uh it's "],["1136.36","water-based however "],["1139.76","in the new Heaven and new

pretty quick "],["1151.82","in verses 9 and 11 we see the first "],["1154.1","thing really to catch John's attention "],["1156.799","verse 9 reads one of the Seven Angels "],["1159.08","who had the seven bowls full of the "],["1160.76","seven last plagues "],["1162.38","came and said to me "],["1164.299","come "],["1165.44","I will show you you the bride and the "],["1168.38","wife of the Bride now it mentions the "],["1170.539","seven bowls here the seven last plagues "],["1172.82","uh those judgments have already taken "],["1176.48","place they those were bulls and plagues "],["1178.76","of judgment their past now but this is "],["1181.22","one of the Angels who is still "],["1183.02","ministering and and revealing things to "],["1186.5","John "],["1188.059","and verse 10 says and he carried me away "],["1190.52","in the spirit to a mountain great and "],["1192.559","high that is Carrie John away "],["1195.44","and showed me the Holy City Jerusalem "],["1198.559","coming down out of Heaven from God "],["1203.059","it's shown with the glory of God "],["1205.46","and its Brilliance was like that of a "],["1207.62","very precious Jewel like a

"],["247.12","james and john two of the disciples they "],["249.92","come up to jesus and they ask "],["252.08","teacher "],["253.36","we want you to do for us whatever we ask "],["257.519","and i

"],["288.32","commitment to do whatever my sister "],["290.16","wants me to do "],["291.68","now from experience i know that she "],["294.24","sometimes asks me to do weird stuff "],["297.28","like

"],["306.8","now so when she gives me that hey can "],["308.639","you do something for me text message i "],["311.28","usually respond with a simple yet "],["313.6","suspicious answer "],["315.6","what do you want "],["318.56","that response makes no commitment "],["321.919","and "],["323.12","oftentimes my sister's requests are "],["325.199","simple and often they are doable but

"],["337.919","hey "],["338.72","can you do something for us and jesus "],["341.199","basically responds with the suspicious "],["344.24","what do you want "],["346.96","james and john then throw out a pretty "],["349.12","outlandish request "],["352.4","they say let one of us sit at the right "],["354.96","and the other at the left in your glory "],["358.4","so what are they asking here "],["360.88","basically what they're asking is to be "],["362.72","in the positions of power in jesus "],["365.52","kingdom they're asking to be the "],["367.28","greatest people in jesus kingdom besides "],["370.56","himself "],["372.4","james and john are over their heads on "],["374","this one "],["374.96","you know they don't know enough "],["376.88","about jesus's kingdom to realize what "],["379.52","they're asking for "],["382.08","they're asking for a favor that jesus "],["384.56","cannot give them "],["386.4","they're asking for favor that if they "],["388.479","understood the nature of jesus's kingdom "],["392.24","that would be a favor that they would "],["393.6","never want "],["395.6","now we have to get deep to understand "],["397.52","all that's going on here so stick with "],["399.6","me as we work through these verses "],["403.52","so after james and john's question "],["406.56","jesus tells james and john that sitting "],["408.8","at his left and right "],["410.8","that those spots are already reserved "],["413.919","and from james and john's point of view "],["415.759","they're like "],["417.039","dang it somebody already got the "],["418.72","positions of power jesus is king and "],["420.639","we're too late "],["423.12","but from jesus's point of view there's a "],["425.12","lot more going on "],["427.599","jesus kingdom is different from the "],["429.919","kingdoms of the world "],["432.4","and we established that last week jesus "],["434.96","kingdom is not a place we can go jesus's "],["438.24","kingdom is the gospel "],["441.919","but for some reason the disciples still "],["443.68","don't understand that "],["445.52","they still think that jesus kingdom is "],["447.52","like the kingdoms of this world one "],["450","based on asserting political power "],["452.88","and "],["453.68","and on awarding great positions to the "],["456.16","most noble of men but jesus's kingdom is "],["460","not one of political power it is one of "],["463.12","gospel power "],["465.44","the power in jesus kingdom comes from "],["468.479","living like jesus "],["471.12","and why is living like jesus powerful "],["474","well because jesus's life showed us the "],["476.879","character of god "],["478.479","and showed us a morality beyond a code "],["481.12","of ethics that stretched "],["483.12","all the way to the motives and the "],["485.36","thoughts behind every one of our actions "],["488.96","it showed a love beyond a respect for "],["491.28","common man "],["493.039","it raised the bar to serving others at "],["496","the price of one's own life "],["499.199","that's true godliness "],["501.36","that's true holiness and that's jesus's "],["504.56","kingdom "],["506.479","james and john on the other hand "],["508.879","they ask to sit on the right on the left "],["511.68","hand of jesus in positions of worldly "],["514.32","power "],["515.44","the problem is that jesus never takes "],["517.44","the throne "],["518.959","jesus never searched his power to do "],["521.12","anything politically "],["523.12","instead jesus takes up his cross "],["528.88","and the one at the right and the left "],["530.8","hand of jesus "],["532.399","and jesus's kingdom that's not james and "],["535.2","john it's not anybody important instead "],["538.16","jesus is crucified and on his left and "],["541.2","on his right "],["542.64","are two thieves "],["544.959","two of the lowliest and most despicable "],["547.6","people "],["548.64","of this world take the left and the "],["550.88","right of jesus and the most important "],["553.519","moment "],["554.56","for jesus and his kingdom "],["556.88","james and john didn't know what they "],["558.32","were asking for "],["560.32","jesus kingdom was still way over their "],["562.72","heads "],["564.32","so let's keep moving on we're going to "],["565.76","move into verse 41. "],["568.32","and verse 41 the rest of the disciples "],["570.959","hear about james and john and they hear "],["573.2","about their attempted a power grab in "],["575.76","jesus kingdom and they still don't "],["577.839","understand what greatness is in jesus "],["580.399","kingdom either so they're mad at james "],["582.08","and john "],["583.2","because they asked before they got "],["585.44","around to it because they're mad "],["588.16","because james and john tried to get "],["589.92","power for themselves without thinking "],["592.08","about the rest of the disciples "],["595.12","now right here i picture jesus just "],["597.12","going like this "],["600.64","i mean the disciples just do not get it "],["603.839","they don't understand jesus's kingdom at "],["606.32","all so let's read along with me "],["609.92","in verse "],["610.92","42-45 as jesus explains to the disciples "],["613.92","what his kingdom is really like "],["618.24","jesus called them together and said "],["620.56","you know that those who were regarded as "],["622.56","rulers of the gentiles lorded over them "],["625.2","and their high officials exercise "],["627.2","authority over them "],["628.8","not so with you instead whoever wants to "],["630.88","become great among you must be your "],["633.12","servant and whoever wants to be first "],["635.839","must be slave of all "],["638.079","for even the son of man did not come to "],["640.079","be served but to serve and give his life "],["644","as a ransom for many "],["646.399","so right there jesus stops the commotion "],["649.519","of the disciples right there jesus turns "],["652.56","everything upside down in his kingdom "],["656.32","he says you know how the rulers of this "],["659.2","world you know how those power they use "],["661.04","their power to exercise authority over "],["663.519","others "],["664.56","in the kingdoms of this world well in my "],["667.2","kingdom it's different "],["669.279","in my kingdom the great ones "],["672","are servants to each other "],["674.88","and they are like slaves to everyone "],["677.839","else they don't use their power for "],["679.839","themselves they use their power to serve "],["683.6","then jesus sets himself up as the "],["685.76","ultimate example "],["687.6","jesus says for even the son of man jesus "],["691.2","the greatest among them by far did not "],["693.6","come to be served like any king or king "],["696.8","of this world "],["698.399","would do "],["699.36","but he came to serve he came to give his "],["702.16","life on the cross as a ransom for many "],["706.88","jesus came to die for us "],["710.48","and this "],["711.76","is the ultimate example of what it means "],["714.24","to be a disciple "],["716.56","that's the ultimate example of what it "],["718.48","means to be part of jesus kingdom "],["721.6","to be on a mission to serve "],["723.839","and not just to serve but to serve "],["726.24","sacrificially "],["728.399","maybe even to our deaths "],["731.92","so what does all of this mean for us "],["733.839","what does it mean for us to be disciples "],["736.72","of jesus how are we supposed to serve "],["739.36","sacrificially "],["741.04","well let's look at the lives of the "],["742.399","disciples how did they end up serving "],["745.92","well they gave up everything they gave "],["747.839","up their jobs their livelihoods their "],["749.76","hobbies "],["750.8","their all "],["752.079","and then they used what time they had "],["754.959","they used whatever resources they had to "],["757.44","spread the gospel throughout the world "],["760.399","they traveled to india to africa through "],["764.079","turkey and even to the capital of the "],["766.079","empire in rome "],["767.76","preaching the gospel and building "],["769.68","churches being jailed and whipped and "],["773.04","persecuted all along the way most were "],["775.68","crucified upside down one was beheaded "],["779.12","and others were stoned or speared to "],["781.279","death "],["782.959","they served sacrificially "],["785.36","they gave their lives for the gospel in "],["788.32","both senses of the word "],["790.16","they spent their lives advancing the "],["792.72","kingdom of jesus and then they laid down "],["795.2","their lives for their commitment to "],["798.839","jesus this is the sacrificial service "],["802.8","that is in the mold of jesus did of what "],["805.68","jesus did for us on the cross that is "],["808.32","what it means to be a disciple "],["811.36","but last week we said that the disciples "],["814.399","aren't our best examples or at least for "],["816.88","most of us because "],["818.8","most of us aren't going to be full-time "],["820.8","missionaries "],["822.079","most of us are not going to be called by "],["824.32","god to sell everything that we have to "],["826.32","go to another country and work to "],["828.72","evangelize that nation "],["830.639","but we are called to a similar standard "],["833.92","of service to the disciples we're called "],["836.8","to be sacrificial in how we serve "],["841.199","but unfortunately "],["842.56","american christianity has lost a good "],["844.72","understanding of what it means to serve "],["847.68","sacrificially "],["849.279","the problem is that our culture has "],["851.519","decided to replace god "],["854.079","with comfort and our culture has decided "],["856.639","to put all their money all their time "],["858.8","and all their aspirations and having a "],["861.12","more plush lifestyle and for some reason "],["864.24","many christians have been heavily "],["866.16","affected by this mentality "],["868.639","american christians often don't want to "],["870.399","serve they want to be comfortable "],["872.56","instead "],["873.839","and many christians in order to maintain "],["876.8","these more comfortable lifestyles have "],["879.12","redefined the word ministry "],["882.16","and today in american christianity "],["884.88","ministry seems to me to mean hanging out "],["889.279","churches brand ministries as things like "],["891.76","church picnics "],["893.199","halloween parties for kids game nights "],["895.68","for college groups "],["897.279","and church dinners "],["899.199","now don't get me wrong those are good "],["901.36","things those are fun things those are "],["904.32","things that get people together and they "],["906.56","make our lives a little bit brighter "],["909.199","but that is not ministry the simple and "],["912.72","most straightforward definition of "],["914.639","ministry that i could come up with is "],["917.12","the act of serving "],["920.16","and these ministries who are we serving "],["923.839","we end up serving ourselves and i think "],["926.8","serving ourselves should not really be "],["929.76","classified as ministry "],["931.92","serving ourselves is pretty comfortable "],["935.04","and a lot of the ways that we do it are "],["937.68","healthy and a lot of it is good but it's "],["940.8","not ministry "],["942.959","ministries serving others "],["945.519","ministry happens when we take our funds "],["947.68","our time our resources and we put those "],["951.199","to use reaching the desperate "],["954.72","so let me give you a picture of how "],["956.56","common christians christians who did not "],["959.12","choose to be full-time missionaries "],["961.199","christians like you "],["962.8","and christians like me "],["964.72","let me get you a picture of how some of "],["966.959","those believers did real ministry "],["970.32","now in the roman empire of early "],["972.48","christianity medical treatment was hard "],["974.8","to come by "],["976.079","if you were sick the only way you would "],["978.16","be able to see a doctor would be to pay "],["980.399","a large sum for a medically trained "],["983.279","person to come and help you "],["985.6","if you didn't have the money to pay that "],["987.12","large expense you weren't getting help "],["990","you would just rely on rumored herbal "],["992.16","treatments or pray to one of the roman "],["994.079","or greek gods for healing "],["996.8","and if you were seriously ill and if you "],["998.8","were in need of long-term care "],["1001.279","well you were pretty much done for "],["1004.079","you'd have "],["1005.279","you'd have to have a ridiculous amount "],["1006.88","of money to afford care and if you were "],["1009.36","contagious nobody was going to dare risk "],["1011.759","coming near you "],["1013.839","now in this environment "],["1016.16","the poor who were sick were forced to "],["1018.72","beg in the street for their income to "],["1021.279","survive while sickness worked its way to "],["1024.72","killing them "],["1027.199","the people that hung out with jesus "],["1029.839","it was these people "],["1031.52","they were the beggars "],["1033.28","who had no money to be healed and jesus "],["1035.839","did the most compassionate thing that he "],["1037.839","could for the most helpless and hopeless "],["1040.72","people in society "],["1044.4","and after jesus was gone christian "],["1046.16","recognized christians recognized that "],["1048.16","the poor and the second society "],["1051.44","were still in desperate need "],["1053.44","christians began to serve the sick for "],["1056","free they began to reach out to those "],["1058.559","who were contagious "],["1060.16","at the risk of their own lives "],["1063.039","they cared for those in society in need "],["1066.32","and when serious plagues hit the roman "],["1068.64","empire "],["1069.84","christians were the only responders "],["1072.72","while the government "],["1074.48","and people in the society ostracized as "],["1077.28","sick "],["1078.559","and let bodies rot in the street "],["1081.679","healthy christians risked sickness and "],["1083.84","death to treat the sick and give proper "],["1086.559","burials to the dead "],["1088.4","christians did not go unnoticed by their "],["1090.72","acts of kindness "],["1092.799","many were saved and many sick were "],["1095.52","nursed back to health "],["1097.6","and these early christians "],["1100","served sacrificially these early "],["1102.48","christians were a blinding light "],["1104.88","to a culture that was so self-obsessed "],["1108.08","they couldn't care about the sick "],["1110.559","and the poor "],["1111.76","christians are really the foundation of "],["1113.6","any modern system of health care that we "],["1115.6","have today "],["1117.36","because christians serve sacrificially "],["1120.48","to meet a desperately they changed the "],["1123.039","world "],["1123.919","by doing it they changed each individual "],["1126.72","life that they touched "],["1128.96","now this is just one example of "],["1131.2","christians serving sacrificially let me "],["1133.44","give you another "],["1135.12","christians are also the foundation for "],["1137.679","basic welfare christians supported the "],["1140.08","poor and as the city and the government "],["1142.32","of rome was falling apart "],["1144.72","the church is what kept the inhabitants "],["1147.44","alive by providing food "],["1149.52","by providing resources for them to "],["1151.52","survive "],["1153.36","now i firmly believe that it's not the "],["1155.76","individuals "],["1157.52","it's not the single "],["1159.84","person "],["1160.96","that has the ability "],["1162.64","to have the greatest impact on the world "],["1165.12","i believe that is the church "],["1167.36","working together serving selflessly in "],["1170.32","ways like the early christians did "],["1173.44","that is what's going to make the biggest "],["1175.12","difference in the lives of people "],["1176.559","throughout the world in the lives of "],["1178.559","people in our community "],["1180.72","when the church meets the needs of the "],["1182.64","desperate the church is at its best "],["1185.76","when the church picks up people who fall "],["1188.32","through the cracks in society the church "],["1190.88","is representing the

the world "],["1214.24","so what do we do about it how are we "],["1216.96","supposed to "],["1218.32","be sacrificially serving like jesus how "],["1220.88","do we fully embrace the gospel "],["1223.679","well first "],["1225.12","we surrender that's what the on the "],["1227.36","mission to surrender inventory last week "],["1230","was designed to do and i've got some "],["1232.4","copies back there if you'd like some for "],["1234.159","the future "],["1235.6","but what we have to do is we have to "],["1237.52","take the next step that a lot of you "],["1239.2","were talking with me about "],["1241.12","last week "],["1242.559","we "],["1243.36","have to "],["1244.559","commit to surrendering our stuff "],["1247.12","because we can't commit to surrendering "],["1248.88","our stuff and then do nothing with it "],["1251.44","because that's just wasteful we have to "],["1253.6","use what we have to serve we have to use "],["1256.799","the time that we have to serve we have "],["1259.28","to use the money that we have to serve "],["1263.679","but where do we serve well let's take "],["1265.76","the early christians as examples we not "],["1268.24","only serve each other as christians but "],["1271.28","we go out of our way to serve those "],["1273.2","outside of the church we can go out of "],["1275.679","our way to look for those desperate and "],["1278.32","to support them where our society is "],["1280.88","failing to do so "],["1282.88","that's what the early christians did "],["1284.48","with health care and that's what the "],["1286.08","early christians did with the "],["1287.919","impoverished and the needy "],["1290.4","to be sacrificial servants and sold out "],["1293.84","disciples of christ faith bible church i "],["1296.159","think "],["1297.039","we need to help change the american "],["1298.88","definition of ministry back to serving "],["1301.6","others "],["1302.799","i think we need to recognize those who "],["1305.6","are desperate in our community and in "],["1308.32","our world "],["1309.76","so who are the desperate let me think of "],["1312.4","some let's see the poor "],["1314.559","the addicts "],["1316.48","the sick the orphans often the elderly "],["1319.44","the unemployed those cut off from family "],["1322.08","the imprisoned "],["1323.919","right there's a very general list but i "],["1326.159","hope it gets your mind going a little "],["1329.039","and this week i made a little "],["1330.48","brainstorming activity for us to get "],["1332.32","thinking about "],["1333.6","serving the desperate around us and i "],["1336","challenge you to think "],["1338","about a desperate person or a desperate "],["1340.4","group that you might think of serving "],["1342.159","yourself and then it challenges you to "],["1344.48","think how faith bible church "],["1347.28","us as a church may serve them "],["1349.679","and i would encourage you if you'd like "],["1351.52","to think about serving more "],["1352.64","sacrificially "],["1354.32","grab one of those brainstorming "],["1355.84","activities and then return it to the "],["1357.919","church if you feel you have an idea for "],["1359.919","ministry that our church can get in on "],["1363.12","but my real challenge for you today is "],["1365.36","long term "],["1367.28","you know if we begin to start some of "],["1369.12","those ministries "],["1370.72","those ministries would be great "],["1373.039","opportunities to be sacrificial servants "],["1375.44","like jesus "],["1377.2","those ministries are things that we need "],["1379.52","to step up and be involved in even if "],["1381.919","they're not comfortable "],["1383.44","because those are the ministries that "],["1385.2","truly show what the gospel is all about "],["1388.64","to the world around us "],["1391.84","faith bible we can be light "],["1395.28","i believe we can truly minister in a way "],["1397.2","that resembles

On a Mission To Surrender (Mark Lindgren)","date":"2013-06-30","transcript":[["16.52","oh thank you Mike and your music team "],["19.84","for leading us this morning in worship "],["22.4","and preparing our hearts to receive "],["24.88","something from the word of God now he "],["27.439","mentioned Mark Mark who well Mark "],["30.039","lingren he's sitting right over here "],["31.96","young man who kind of grew up here I "],["33.92","think you've been here at this church "],["35.52","about a quarter of your life would that "],["37.04","be fair to say yeah uh but Mark has been "],["40.44","here for quite a few years and uh is "],["44.039","today "],["45.559","interning uh what's the name of that "],["49.28","College in college anyway or he's ining "],["52.16","at Faith Bible Church but in college and "],["54.28","on summer vacation and so we asked him "],["56.52","to help out here this summer now one "],["59.12","might wonder well how is it that we've "],["60.96","got the courage to put such a young man "],["63.239","here to fill Pastor Rob's shoes on a "],["65.239","Sunday morning but he's not a novice "],["68.08","he's a veteran he preached already once "],["70.119","this morning "],["73.56","so that makes him a veteran but uh Mark "],["77.479","has uh been working here with Pastor Rob "],["79.96","and and kind of shadowing the pastor uh "],["82.439","during the during the work week uh as a "],["84.759","matter of fact we had him at one of the "],["85.84","elders meetings just so he could see how "],["87.36","we interact and make make decisions and "],["90.4","and how we work uh but he's a great "],["93.28","asset here and uh he agreed to bring the "],["95.68","message for two Sundays this Sunday and "],["98.28","next Sunday and uh "],["100.479","so uh that's quite a job for a young man "],["104.04","but he's fully capable of doing that and "],["106.24","we appreciate uh uh his work here "],["108.68","there's a couple of things different "],["109.719","about Faith Bible Church though why we "],["111.32","would risk that number one this is a "],["114.84","church there's a three things that's "],["117.479","really unique about faith but one is we "],["119.159","have weekly Comm communion most churches "],["121.439","don't do that there I think there's one "],["122.759","other Church in the county that does uh "],["125.32","but we have weekly communion we offer it "],["126.799","at the first service uh the second thing "],["129.28","is the church is I know you might think "],["132.16","this is strange some of you but it's "],["134.239","really not led by Pastor Rob it's led by "],["136.48","a plural plurality of Elders uh Pastor "],["139.76","Rob being one of the elders we might "],["141.48","call him the teaching Elder uh so he "],["144.12","hard again you might not believe this "],["146.2","but it's true there's hardly a decision "],["148.16","made that he makes on his own he makes "],["150.519","it with the consent of the other Elders "],["152.44","now day-to-day things naturally we're "],["154.84","not here and he has to make uh make "],["157.319","those kinds of decisions but all "],["159.239","anything of any significance or major is "],["161.239","made as a consensus of the a decision by "],["164.239","the elders and so the third thing though "],["166.8","about Faith Bible Church is we place an "],["169.04","emphasis on our young people and our "],["170.92","youth you notice they're up here leading "],["174.159","you in worship they're ministering to "],["175.76","you they're going on missions trips they "],["177.56","are doing things far more than many of "],["179.92","us as adults do uh here at the church "],["182.36","and so uh we try to Foster that and "],["184.799","create an environment where they can do "],["186.64","that and that's part of the reason why "],["189","Mark lingren is going to speak to you "],["191.12","today so come on up here Mark Mark uh "],["194.56","are you all set now I had to adjust his "],["196.799","mic at the first service as a reason and "],["198.68","give him a once over make sure "],["199.92","everything was okay but he looks good to "],["201.72","go so we'll let him fly okay well uh "],["206.08","thank you dig I think uh you forgot one "],["208.68","distinctive "],["210.439","um we have dig Neva here at Faith Bible "],["215.879","Church you may be surprised to hear this "],["218.959","but we are the only church in St Mary's "],["221.76","County that have dick Neva here pretty "],["225.12","much every week so thank you "],["229.84","ding thank you so much um well good "],["232.799","morning Faith Bible Church oh thank you "],["236.04","guys um it's been a great experience "],["238.4","this summer to be able to work in this "],["240.76","church and to help out where I can and "],["243.439","while Pastor Rob's taking a little break "],["245.12","to spend time with family spend a little "],["247.28","bit of time with God uh the place where "],["249.92","I'm tasked to help out is right here so "],["253.439","for the next two weeks I'll be doing my "],["255.76","best to provide the solid Biblical "],["258.32","teaching that Pastor Rob does so well "],["260.799","here every "],["262.24","week these next two weeks we're going to "],["264.52","take a break from the book of 1 "],["268.12","Samuel and we're going to answer this "],["270.639","question what does it mean to be a "],["273.72","disciple of Christ now I have titled "],["277.28","this two sermon "],["278.84","miniseries uh on a mission because I "],["281.6","feel like it's a good phrase to describe "],["284.12","what I feel like the answer to that "],["286.039","question is what does it mean to be a "],["289.96","disciple of Christ I think it means to "],["293.039","be on a "],["294.32","mission now what does it mean to be on a "],["297.08","mission well I think it starts with a "],["300.28","correct understanding of what Jesus was "],["303.36","doing while he was here on Earth Jesus's "],["307.44","goal was not just to affect us inward or "],["312.68","mentally Jesus did not come to affect "],["316","you or me in "],["319.319","isolation Jesus came to announce a "],["322.44","social Revolution a different way to "],["325.88","live Jesus came to change the way the "],["329.84","world is through his "],["332.08","followers and while he's on Earth Jesus "],["335.08","came to announce an amazing thing that "],["338.319","in Jesus's Kingdom we can know God and "],["342.6","we can seek to live like God so when I "],["346.56","talk about Jesus's declaration as his "],["349.319","kingdom I want you to understand with me "],["351.84","that this kingdom is not one in the "],["354.36","traditional sense of the word joining "],["357.12","Jesus his kingdom does not mean "],["359","traveling in to some place and then "],["361.479","getting a green card that says citizen "],["364.16","of Jesus's Kingdom now when Jesus talks "],["368.24","about his kingdom and the gospels he is "],["370.68","talking about the "],["373.039","gospel he is talking about a figurative "],["376.319","Kingdom made up of followers who choose "],["378.759","to accept his sacrifice on the cross for "],["382.44","our "],["383.4","sins but those followers also take a "],["387.72","step they are sold out for Jesus's "],["392.08","Kingdom you could say that they are on a "],["395.52","mission to seeing Jesus's Kingdom "],["398.479","advancing in their own hearts and in the "],["402.759","world this is what I think it means to "],["406.36","be a disciple of Jesus So today we're "],["409.36","going to look at that first step of what "],["411.88","it means to be sold out for Jesus's "],["414.44","Kingdom today we're going to look at the "],["416.879","first step of what it means to be a "],["420.08","disciple and today we're going to learn "],["422.319","what it means to be on a mission to "],["425.16","surrender so let's pray and we'll get "],["427.52","into the word of God for us "],["431.52","today Father God this "],["433.8","opportunity is so humbling to me I know "],["437.44","that you put this topic of what it means "],["439.24","to follow your son Jesus in my mind for "],["442.36","a reason and I pray that you would help "],["444.56","pull all of that together here "],["446.52","today I pray that you'd help me and help "],["449.479","all of us to have the strength to be on "],["452.16","a mission and to accept all that your "],["455.52","kingdom asks from us in Jesus name I "],["459.16","pray "],["460.96","amen so if you have your Bible today "],["463.84","please open with me to the Book of Mark "],["466.199","and we're going to look at chapter 10 "],["468.319","ver 17 through 31 so "],["472.159","unfortunately we're not going to be able "],["473.879","to read the entire 15 verse passage this "],["476.44","morning because there's just not time "],["479.599","typical preacher thing to say but I feel "],["482.84","like I had to say um I'd encourage you "],["485.56","this week to read through that passage "],["487.68","though and just to think about what that "],["490.039","means for your life so starting in verse "],["493.479","17 I'm going to summarize what happens "],["495.879","in this "],["497.44","passage okay so a man runs up to Jesus "],["501.479","and he falls on his knees asking Jesus "],["506.4","what must I do to inherit eternal "],["510.879","life now there's two things I want you "],["513.479","to notice about this man first this man "],["516.719","comes "],["518.159","seeking eternal life he falls on his "],["522.279","knees in the middle of the street to ask "],["525.48","Jesus this question he's definitely "],["527.44","seeking and he's seeking eternal life "],["530.72","second this man is pretty obedient to "],["533.399","the Commandments why how how do we know "],["535.88","that well he says so but but still Jesus "],["540.48","says that that's not enough those two "],["543.2","things that seeking seeking Jesus for "],["546.839","eternal life and being obedient to the "],["548.92","Commandments Jesus says that's not "],["551.36","enough Jesus finally answers the man's "],["554.64","question on how he can inherit eternal "],["557.04","life in verse 21 of Mark 10 it says one "],["562.16","thing you lack Jesus said go and sell "],["565.24","everything you have and give to the poor "],["567.68","and you will have treasure in heaven "],["570.12","then come follow "],["573.24","me Jesus tells this man that he lacks "],["576.48","one thing he has to sell everything that "],["580.72","he has and then he can follow Jesus but "],["585.2","instead of selling everything to follow "],["588","Jesus the man walks away sad he walks "],["591.279","away unwilling to sell off his great "],["594.16","wealth to follow Jesus and inherit "],["598.079","eternal life "],["600.959","now it'll be really easy to stop Jesus "],["603.04","here talk about the dangers of wealth "],["605.92","but I can't jump to conclusions yet this "],["608.64","is just the situation that Jesus is "],["610.76","using as a Spur to teach his disciples "],["614.16","something so we have to hold off on "],["616.959","determining what the message of this "],["620.079","passage is until we Let Jesus speak so "],["623.079","was part of interning at Faith pretty "],["625.519","much every week Pastor Rob comes into my "],["627.56","office or I go into his office and he'll "],["629.88","give a teaching similar to the way that "],["631.959","Jesus does "],["633.76","here so one day while interning at Faith "],["636.92","Bible Pastor Rob was discussing with me "],["639.72","whether I should do a task or whether we "],["641.72","should have a volunteer do it and he "],["643.88","ended up deciding on that volunteer now "],["646.88","I could almost immediately see in Pastor "],["649.32","Rob's eyes that this Spurs something "],["651.839","that I like to call a teaching moment "],["654.48","about his philosophy of "],["657.04","ministry now instead of listening "],["659.68","I bust in and I said hold on Pastor I "],["661.92","see what you're trying to say you know "],["663.72","the more work that we give to volunteers "],["666.079","the less stressful our lives are and the "],["669.079","less stressful our lives are the happier "],["671.76","we are and you know what God wants us to "],["674.16","be happy so I get it I get what you're "],["676.32","saying great teaching moment Pastor Rob "],["678.56","tell next "],["679.959","time well I obviously didn't say that "],["683","you probably tell for two reasons first "],["685.839","because it's not theologically "],["687.639","correct second "],["689.959","I never interrupt a pastor Rob teaching "],["694.72","moment you know Pastor Rob is much more "],["698.16","of an expert on Ministry than I am and I "],["701.079","should be learning pretty much "],["702.48","everything that I possibly can from him "],["705.2","so what I did was I sat back and I "],["708.16","listen without jumping to conclusions "],["710.44","wondering whoa what is he going to teach "],["713.24","me "],["714.36","next now in the same way we should "],["716.76","resist the temptation to develop our own "],["719","own conclusions about this teaching "],["721.92","moment of Jesus until Jesus has actually "],["726.68","taught us and we need to sit back and "],["729.56","listen and be wondering whoa what is "],["732.839","Jesus going to teach us "],["734.839","next so let's keep summarizing Jesus in "],["737.44","this teaching moment so there's two more "],["740.399","details that I want you to notice from "],["742.399","this next part of the passage first "],["745.12","Jesus says that a rich person being "],["747.519","saved is very hard "],["749.519","or basically "],["751.72","impossible Jesus says that it's harder "],["754.839","for a rich man to enter the kingdom than "],["757.6","for a camel to go through the eye of a "],["762.12","needle yeah that sounds pretty "],["764","impossible to me Jesus pretty impossible "],["766.839","in fact Jesus says that salvation for "],["769.92","anyone is really hard so why is it "],["772.6","really "],["774","hard well because Jesus's Kingdom calls "],["777.959","us to Sur "],["779.36","surrender people don't like to surrender "],["782.48","you know the rich man did not like to "],["784.36","surrender so he kept his stuff and he "],["787.519","left salvation with "],["790.56","Jesus okay second Point fortunately "],["794.88","salvation is not on "],["797.959","us Jesus says that salvation is "],["800.8","impossible with man but nothing is "],["804.839","impossible with "],["807.24","God God said saves people people do not "],["810.44","save people that's why any rich man can "],["813.48","be saved or any of us can be saved "],["816.959","because God Saves people people do not "],["820.44","save "],["822.279","themselves now we could stop Jesus at "],["824.56","this point and we could be like Jesus I "],["827.24","get your teaching point now we cannot be "],["830.399","saved on our own it's all God you know "],["833.399","thank goodness great theological message "],["835.839","Jesus feels so encouraged now we could "],["838.56","do do that but I think what we would be "],["841.399","missing is exactly what Jesus is trying "],["843.839","to say so notice with something with me "],["848.399","notice that Jesus is not using a "],["850.8","situation where God saved a rich man "],["855.24","Jesus is using a situation where a rich "],["858.56","man rejected God he's talking about a "],["863.04","stumbling block to Salvation that is "],["865.959","hard for the rich to overcome a "],["869.16","stumbling block is hard for any of us to "],["872.639","overcome so let's pick things up in "],["875.36","verse "],["876.279","28 so following Jesus's theological "],["879.6","point the disciple Peter blurts out we "],["883.199","have left everything to follow "],["886.079","you and my response to Peter would be "],["889.759","you know what very true Peter you're "],["891.519","right the disciples did leave everything "],["894.04","behind to follow Jesus they left their "],["896.399","jobs behind they left their family "],["898.92","behind along with all their other "],["900.56","Hobbies all their other interests they "],["902.68","devoted all of their resources and all "],["905.8","of their time to "],["908.36","Jesus now earlier In this passage Jesus "],["911.6","asked the rich men to do what the "],["914.399","disciples did to surrender everything "],["917.639","sell it all and follow Jesus but the "],["920.8","rich man turned away Peter notices that "],["924.72","the disciples were different from that "],["927.24","rich man and Peter wonders what does "],["929.839","that mean for us are we going to be "],["931.48","saved what does our sacrifice mean to "],["935.279","Jesus's Kingdom so follow along with me "],["938.12","in verse 29 through "],["940.68","31 as we read Jesus's "],["943.92","answer truly I tell you Jesus replied no "],["948.16","one who has left home or brothers or "],["951.72","sisters or mother or father or children "],["954.759","or felds for me in the gospel will fail "],["957.36","to receive aund times as much in this "],["960.16","present age homes brothers sisters "],["963.44","mothers children's and Fields along with "],["966.12","persecutions and in the age to come "],["969.079","eternal life but many who are first will "],["972.639","be last and the last "],["976.36","first now in response to Peter's bold "],["979.959","assertion that the disciples had left "],["983.04","everything behind to follow Jesus Jesus "],["986.04","says that no one who sacrificed "],["988.6","everything would go "],["991.079","unrewarded now the last verse sums up "],["993.519","this whole passage very "],["996.24","well but many who are first will be last "],["999.8","and the last "],["1001.639","first now that verse was very confusing "],["1004.56","to me as I was first studying this "],["1006.56","passage uh I was like what who is he "],["1010.399","talking about who's first who's last "],["1013.759","where what how when why basically a lot "],["1017.72","of exclamation points points paired with "],["1019.48","a ton of question "],["1021.399","marks but after a while of studying and "],["1024.799","a lot of staring I think I understand "],["1027.959","this verse a little bit "],["1030.319","better by saying that many who are first "],["1033.88","will be last and the last first Jesus is "],["1036.76","comparing the rich man and the "],["1040.319","disciples the rich man would be seen as "],["1042.959","one of the first or the greatest in "],["1046.12","basically every Kingdom on this Earth "],["1048.88","just like it is today it's still the "],["1051.6","rich the famous those who have versus "],["1055.2","those who have not who are on top who "],["1058","are seen as the greatest but Jesus says "],["1061.679","Nope many who are first now when it "],["1065.6","comes uh when it comes to my kingdom "],["1068.08","those people they're going to be "],["1071.84","last and the last right now the Have "],["1075.36","Nots the people who have basically "],["1077.76","nothing the those people are going to be "],["1079.96","the first in Jesus's Kingdom the ones on "],["1083.159","the top of the totem pole in Jesus's "],["1085.679","Kingdom will be the poor not the "],["1089.76","rich Jesus's Kingdom Vision that we get "],["1092.48","from this verse is one that totally "],["1094.64","Turns Upside Down the way our culture "],["1097.799","and the way our world looks and who's "],["1101.48","greatest to fully surrender and to fully "],["1104.919","join in on Jesus's New Kingdom Vision "],["1107.44","the disciples had to give up everything "],["1110.6","and to become the have not of this world "],["1115.44","and Jesus called the rich man to do the "],["1118.159","same to give up everything to become one "],["1121.36","of the Have Nots in the eyes of this "],["1124.44","world because in the

"],["1179.88","talking about surrender in a spiritual "],["1182.6","sense because Jesus isn't talking about "],["1185.08","it in a spiritual sense here I'm talking "],["1187.96","about surrender in a

"],["1215.24","to make sure we understand how "],["1217.76","surrendering all of that looks now the "],["1220.88","easiest and most direct picture we get "],["1223.039","of what it means to surrender everything "],["1225.4","is the disciples and they saw that "],["1228.28","everything and they basically became "],["1230.52","traveling "],["1231.679","missionaries now calm down everybody I'm "],["1233.84","not going to tell you all to sell "],["1235.52","everything you have and all of you to "],["1237.24","become all full-time "],["1239.159","missionaries because that's not "],["1241","consistent with the New Testament "],["1242.64","picture of "],["1243.88","surrender we see people in the New "],["1246.679","Testament who are faithful "],["1250.12","Christians who are

"],["1316.76","willing to do so now now I can do "],["1318.72","whatever I want with my stuff no that "],["1322.679","attitude sounds nothing like a person "],["1325.64","who is on a mission to

"],["1348.4","whatever we want with whatever we "],["1351.72","have so notice there are two extremes "],["1355.279","first it's wrong for us to interpret "],["1357.48","this passage to mean that all of us need "],["1359.919","to sell everything and become full-time "],["1361.72","missionaries but it would also be wrong "],["1364.4","to interpret this passage to mean that "],["1366.32","we can do

"],["1391","Testament Jesus calls us to surrender "],["1394.24","everything that we have for his kingdom "],["1397.36","and in the New Testament those who have "],["1399.72","stuff do not sell

and this type "],["275.8","of training we train people in a "],["278.199","reproducible and affordable way so that "],["281","it can multiply "],["283.28","exponentially one problem that we had in "],["286.16","missions is people trying to figure out "],["288.039","how do we train enough pastors for this "],["290.479","growing "],["291.84","need which religion is the fastest "],["294.24","growing religion in the world I surprise "],["298.56","you Evangelical Christianity is the "],["302","fastest grown religion in the world "],["304.08","Christianity is the fastest grown

of the church taking place "],["345.12","in other parts of the world it's amazing "],["347.759","and um I even shared with someone this "],["349.68","morning during our break about how we're "],["352.16","training "],["353.24","people who probably in turn their kids "],["357.039","can come back here as missionaries to "],["358.44","our people "],["360.44","30 some years from now you're going to "],["362.28","have some black Africans come into "],["364","America to evangelize rck you know "],["368.12","they're already doing it Kenyans are "],["369.639","already sending missionaries

is going up "],["379.919","spiritually and "],["381.44","economically and we the ones having some "],["384.72","problems but what we do with our "],["386.44","ministry is train people because one "],["388.72","reason is not just to reach them but who "],["391.479","do you want coming back to your kids "],["393.88","years from now they going be biblically "],["395.639","based people who

"],["1628.72","Acts 13: 3 and 4 then having fasted and "],["1632.64","prayed and laid hands on them they sent "],["1634.2","them away so being sent out by the Holy "],["1636.64","Spirit went downia

"],[25.72,"just don't know I am not pesing nut I'm "],[28.28,"a little bit taller than he is I am not "],[31.04,"Pastor Mark I'm a little bit shorter "],[32.56,"than he is so who am I I am the third "],[37.44,"string so they called me and told me "],[40.92,"that they needed someone to fill and I "],[42.52,"said I know a thing or two so here I am "],[44.76,"to tell you guys a thing or two so what "],[48.76,"I'm here to tell you guys about today is "],[50.24,"the importance of "],[52.08,"timing um I throughout most of my life "],[56.12,"have played sports that involve time I "],[58.64,"was a swimmer in high school I ran cross "],[60.8,"country in college and I did track um at "],[63.12,"the school it was a D3 school don't be "],[65.36,"too "],[66.04,"impressed um but that's when it comes to "],[69.88,"those kind of sports timing is very "],[71.56,"important it literally comes down to "],[73.96,"seconds sometimes between Victory and "],[76.2,"defeat when I was in a swim team you "],[79.04,"guys might remember Michael Phelps won a "],[80.8,"gold medal by one 100th of a second it "],[84.92,"came down to that's little who barely "],[88.56,"brushed the pad first "],[90.88,"and that was very exciting at the time "],[93.24,"and it still kind of "],[94.68,"is but um a joke can live or die by how "],[99.64,"it's delivered in the timing that's why "],[101.6,"dad jokes are so painful sometimes "],[104.24,"because it's either at the worst time of "],[105.6,"the timing delivery is just terrible uh "],[108.04,"I'm the king of saying jokes at the "],[109.92,"worst time possible uh music is dictated "],[115.32,"by can the musician keep time which is "],[118,"why I'm not very good at music because I "],[120.04,"don't keep time very "],[122.92,"well when it comes to events and places "],[126.12,"timing down to the seconds can make all "],[128.08,"the difference in the world it can be "],[129.16,"the difference between Victory and "],[130.32,"defeat life or death but I'm here today "],[133.92,"to tell you that sometimes "],[136.04,"timing can be can bring "],[139.48,"assurance and this assurance is one of "],[142.64,"God's gifts to us Pastor mcnut has been "],[144.88,"talking about these gifts that God gives "],[147.08,"to us and this is one that he has given "],[148.68,"to us a urance so how does timing give "],[153,"us "],[154.16,"Assurance well if you have your Bibles I "],[156.32,"want you to turn to Galatians chapter 4 "],[159.4,"veres "],[160.24,"4-7 and then while you're doing that put "],[162.88,"your finger in it flip over to Luke "],[165.72,"Chapter 2 "],[169.2,"1-7 so again Galatians 4 4-7 finger in "],[173.08,"it go over to Luke 2: "],[176.8,"1-7 you guys probably recognize the Luke "],[179.48,"Passage it's the very basic Christmas "],[181.36,"Story you know we've been reading it to "],[182.76,"our daughters and you know familiarizing "],[184.68,"themselves with why we're doing "],[186,"Christmas um but we're going to read it "],[188.12,"anyway also you don't normally think of "],[190.8,"Galatians as a Christmas passage but "],[193.12,"when you look at it it starts with "],[195.36,"starting at verse four but with the "],[197.32,"fullness or when the fullness of time "],[199.08,"had come God sent forth his son born of "],[201.68,"a woman born under the law to redeem "],[204.08,"those who are under the law that they "],[205.92,"might receive the adoption as Sons "],[210.16,"and because you are Sons God has sent "],[212.2,"forth the spirit of his "],[215.12,"son into our hearts crying out Abba "],[217.96,"Father therefore you are no longer a "],[219.72,"slave but a son and if a son then an "],[222,"heir of God through Christ and then you "],[224.76,"hop over to Luke "],[227.12,"2 and it came to pass in those days that "],[230.4,"a decree went out from Caesar Augustus "],[232.24,"that the world should be registered this "],[234.44,"census first took place "],[237.44,"while cinius was govern Syria so all "],[241.28,"went to be registered everyone to his "],[243.16,"own City Joseph also went up From "],[245.84,"Galilee out of the city of Nazareth to "],[247.76,"Judea to the city of David which is "],[249.84,"called Bethlehem because he was at the "],[251.88,"house and lineage of David to be "],[253.48,"registered with Mary his betroth wife "],[255.88,"who was with child so it was while they "],[258.92,"were there the days were complete for "],[260.4,"her to be delivered and she brought "],[261.88,"forth her firstborn son and wrapped him "],[264,"swaddling clothes and laid him in the "],[265.64,"manger because there was no room for "],[267.4,"them in the "],[268.52,"end as as I was thinking through and "],[270.76,"looking for my topic today I kept coming "],[272.84,"back to this phrase in Galatians in the "],[276.28,"fullness of "],[277.72,"time the phrase could also be worded as "],[281.12,"the perfect time or the set "],[284.52,"time at the absolute right moment Jesus "],[289.16,"was "],[290,"born the sun was sent down to earth and "],[293.52,"as I thought of this I noticed you go "],[296,"over to Luke and it says uh it came to "],[298.76,"pass in those days but It also says her "],[301.44,"the days were complete for her to be "],[304.36,"delivered so we see this idea in both "],[307.2,"passages of perfect time or the "],[309,"Fulfillment of time and I started to "],[311.16,"consider the importance of the timing of "],[313.56,"Jesus's birth so what was so perfect "],[316.8,"about it well I'm really glad you asked "],[320.76,"first of all it was the perfect time for "],[323.04,"him to fulfill prophecy concerning the "],[325.36,"resurrection why are we looking at the "],[327.08,"resurrection aren't we talking about "],[328.2,"Christmas stuff well "],[330.44,"Christmas looks forward to Easter Easter "],[332.16,"looks forward to Christmas without "],[333.8,"Easter there is no Christmas without "],[335.08,"Christmas there is no "],[336.36,"Easter so we look at both "],[339.92,"simultaneously and the resurrection is "],[343.64,"the single most important event in human "],[346.12,"history but we go back to the birth if "],[349.12,"Jesus had been born 50 years previously "],[351.68,"going back into "],[353.88,"BC blasphemy was a crime that was "],[356.4,"punished by "],[357.56,"stoning the Jews still had a little bit "],[360.2,"of control over their own judicial "],[361.8,"system so they could have tried Jesus "],[364.96,"and executed themselves but the Jewish "],[367.36,"way was "],[368.92,"stoning however if he had come 50 years "],[371.8,"later going into "],[373.52,"ad then he wouldn't have been convicted "],[376.64,"at all because the Romans had taken "],[378.44,"control of the judicial system and they "],[380.72,"didn't care about blasphemy like that "],[382.8,"they weren't going to execute a man over "],[384.32,"that and when you're trying to convict a "],[386.52,"sinless man the only thing you're really "],[387.96,"going to get him on is is blasphemy and "],[391.04,"if it's not a crime he can't be tried "],[393,"with it the reason he came right when he "],[395.44,"did was because the Jews still had "],[399.04,"influence enough to say blasphemy is a "],[401.44,"crime we should convict him of it but "],[403.28,"the Romans were the ones in charge that "],[405.64,"actually carried out that "],[407.84,"execution and why was that so important "],[410.24,"well it was to fulfill certain "],[411.68,"prophecies like in Psalm 22 and you may "],[414.88,"recognize the first verse of Psalm 22 "],[417.68,"I'm going to read verse 1 and 16 18 "],[420.56,"we're going to be reading a lot of "],[421.56,"scripture today just bear with me and if "],[424.28,"you want to go back and like we do have "],[426.16,"the videos online so if I go too fast at "],[428.24,"any point you're like oh I wanted that "],[429.44,"verse you can go back and check it out "],[431.72,"um Psalm 2211 16-18 my God my God why "],[436.28,"have you forsaken me and then jumping to "],[438.08,"verse 16 dogs surrounded me a pack of "],[440.52,"villain encircles me they pierce my "],[442.32,"hands and my feet all my bones are on "],[444.4,"display people stare and gloat over me "],[446.44,"they divide my clothes among them and "],[448.16,"they cast lots for their G or for my "],[450.8,"garments now I picked these verses for a "],[453.24,"particular reason we talked about the "],[454.96,"first verse because you guys may "],[457.08,"recognize it where else have we seen "],[459.56,"this in "],[461.92,"scripture at the crucifixion Jesus says "],[464.96,"it from the cross right so why does he "],[468.2,"do that because at the time they didn't "],[470.76,"have the Psalms numbered it wasn't "],[472.56,"turned to Psalm 22 it was by the first "],[476.2,"verse that they would know them so it "],[477.96,"was by a title that they gave it first "],[479.8,"verse so when Jesus says my God my God "],[482.56,"why have you forsaken me he's then "],[484.44,"calling into mind the entirety of Psalm "],[486.52,"22 for the Jewish audience watching this "],[488.84,"crucifixion it would be like me saying "],[490.96,"Sweet Caroline and the rest of you guys "],[493.68,"go exactly see so he's calling to mind "],[498.2,"something they already know to bring the "],[500.48,"rest into "],[501.76,"recollection and then the reason I "],[503.48,"picked up these other verses because you "],[505.72,"look at it you can see the prophecies "],[507.28,"being fulfilled dogs surround me "],[509.56,"generally a name used for Gentiles don't "],[512.6,"get offended it's what they called us "],[515.88,"all so he was surrounded by the Roman "],[518.52,"Gentiles they were the ones nailing him "],[520.4,"to the Cross they have pierced my hands "],[522,"and "],[523.44,"feet and it was he was crucified in a "],[526.68,"very exposing manner the point one of "],[528.48,"the point of crucifixion was one "],[530,"humiliation you're putting them on "],[531.36,"display in front of everyone the other "],[533.08,"one was to instill fear of this will "],[536.52,"happen to you if you don't fall in line "],[539.04,"so he's in a very exposing manner all my "],[541.4,"bones are on display people stare and "],[542.96,"gloat over me the mocking of the crowd "],[545.6,"and then also the dividing of the "],[547.6,"garments and the casting of lots all of "],[549.96,"this we see at the crucifixion being "],[552.76,"fulfilled "],[559.4,"fully Sorry God is not fooling around "],[562.88,"with this prophecies it's also very "],[565.48,"important uh the timing of everything "],[567.8,"it's also very important because the "],[569.36,"mesiah had to be born in Bethlehem Micah "],[572.96,"52 says but you Bethlehem "],[578.56,"F though you are small among the clans "],[580.96,"of Judah out of you will come from me "],[583.12,"one who will be ruler over Israel whose "],[585.48,"Origins are from old and from ancient "],[587.96,"times however the problem is that Mary "],[591.04,"and Joseph currently reside "],[593.4,"in "],[595.48,"Nazareth Nazareth is not Bethlehem so "],[598.56,"how do we get "],[600.28,"nazarin from Nazareth to "],[603.68,"Bethlehem census "],[607.76,"taxes and so at just the right time "],[611.92,"Caesar Augustus also known as Octavius "],[614.76,"you know the guy who had been uh had the "],[616.56,"fight with Mark Anthony and Cleopatra "],[618.2,"for control of the the Roman Empire he "],[620.56,"finally got control of everything he "],[622.04,"instilled What's called the Pax Romana "],[624.52,"uh the Roman peace and they had just "],[627.04,"started invading into Germany so you "],[629.56,"know they were trying to expand the "],[630.56,"borders of their empire which um and he "],[633.92,"also was getting old so he was trying to "],[635.48,"find his Heir so he's also doing some "],[637.64,"things with that all of this cost money "],[641.2,"and when the government needs money they "],[644.48,"tax "],[646.52,"yay and "],[648.28,"so because of the census which Caesar "],[650.8,"Augustus declares because he needs money "],[652.64,"to fund his military campaigns and "],[654.4,"protect the peace especially when you do "],[656.04,"it through military you need a lot of "],[658.24,"money political tension and necessity "],[660.84,"moved Jesus to the exact spot that he "],[663.44,"was being prophesied to be born in at "],[665.64,"the exact moment Mary's days were to be "],[669.04,"completed and throughout Jesus's life "],[671.28,"there were so many prophecies fulfilled "],[674.12,"and we're going to go through just a few "],[675.76,"of them here starting back in Genesis "],[679.08,"chter 3 the very first one Genesis 3:15 "],[682.84,"I will put enity between you and the "],[684.64,"woman and between your seed and her seed "],[687.08,"he shall bruise your head and you shall "],[688.84,"bruise his heal this being spoken to the "],[691.4,"serpent talking about how God is going "],[693.48,"to provide someone to destroy the "],[695.56,"serpent going to Genesis 123 I will "],[698.6,"bless those who bless you and I'll curse "],[700.16,"him who curse you and in you all the "],[703,"families of the Earth shall be "],[704.88,"blessed implying Jesus being the "],[707.44,"blessing to all of us Jew and Gentile "],[709.64,"alike Isaiah 7:14 talking about the "],[712.68,"Immaculate Conception therefore the Lord "],[714.48,"himself shall give you a sign behold the "],[716.56,"Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and "],[718.64,"shall call his name "],[720.76,"Emmanuel meaning God With Us Jesus's "],[724.2,"other name as we know him is Jesus or in "],[726.24,"the Hebrew Yeshua meaning God Saves both "],[729.8,"these names outlining what he's there to "],[731.92,"do he is God With Us and also here to "],[734.8,"save Psalm 729 okay this one is a little "],[738.08,"bit debatable but I'm going to put it in "],[739.68,"here anyway uh Psalm 729 those who dwell "],[742.28,"in the wilderness will bow before him "],[743.84,"and the enemies will lick the dust um "],[746.8,"often thought to be referred to "],[748.52,"referring to the Shepherds who are out "],[749.72,"in the fields in the wilderness watching "],[751.04,"and tending their sheep Angels come tell "],[753.28,"them they go and they worship so "],[755.08,"fulfilling Psalm 729 Hosea 5:11 talking "],[759.08,"about his birth and Retreat to Egypt "],[761.44,"when Israel was a child I loved him and "],[763.56,"out of Egypt I called my son now again "],[766.48,"referring to what I was talking about "],[768.24,"Scholars debate this and we'll talk "],[769.56,"about this in a second this could be "],[771.08,"talking about Jesus being born in Israel "],[773.4,"as a child God loving him and then "],[776.4,"protecting him as he flees Herod down to "],[778.6,"Egypt this could also just be him "],[781.04,"talking about you know pulling the "],[782.76,"Israelites out of Egypt it really just "],[785.56,"depends how you look at it "],[788.32,"so Isaiah 9:6 he would come as a child "],[792.48,"for unto us a child is born unto us a "],[794.64,"savior is given and the government will "],[796.12,"be upon his shoulders his name will be "],[798.12,"wonderful counselor Mighty God "],[800.36,"Everlasting father Prince of Peace and "],[802.64,"then also there's the entirety of Isaiah "],[804.32,"53 which I didn't feel like putting on "],[807.16,"15 slides to get to you guys so so just "],[809.48,"go look at on your own time numbers "],[811.52,"23:17 the star marks the spot I see him "],[814.84,"but not now I Behold Him but not near a "],[817.52,"star shall come out of Jacob a scepter "],[819.44,"shall rise out of Israel and batter the "],[821.44,"brow of Moab and destroy all the sons of "],[824,"tumul this one's really interesting "],[826.52,"because this prophecy wasn't even given "],[828.08,"to Israel it was given to tribes that "],[830.48,"were in the east of Israel and so "],[832.56,"they're given a prophecy that talks "],[833.92,"about a star rising out of Jacob so then "],[836.52,"Jesus is born and what marks the spot "],[839.92,"the star and then lo and behold who "],[842,"comes to see him wise men from the East "],[845.64,"that have been looking at the prophecy "],[847.24,"and saw the Fulfillment and went that's "],[849.4,"how they knew that the King was "],[851.88,"coming and then finally uh well not "],[855.32,"finally quite but 2 Samuel 72-4 that he "],[858.56,"shall be from the line of David when "],[860.2,"your days are fulfilled and you rest "],[861.36,"with your fathers I will set up your "],[862.56,"seed after you and you will come from "],[864.12,"your Bo who will come from your body and "],[866.48,"I will establish his kingdom and he "],[867.68,"shall build a house for my name and I "],[869.24,"establish the Throne of his kingdom "],[870.44,"forever I will be his father and he "],[872.56,"shall be my son now we could sit here "],[876.56,"all day and just pick through every "],[878.88,"instance of Prophecy that Jesus had "],[881.04,"fulfilled Scholars have debated this but "],[883.92,"it's generally agreed that about 300 "],[886.92,"prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus's "],[889.96,"lifetime the number can get up to 570 "],[893.88,"depending what you determin to be a "],[895.32,"prophecy concerning Jesus but we know "],[896.96,"for certain 300 of them were filled "],[899.64,"and 300 is still a "],[902.72,"lot so you get the point "],[905.88,"regardless 300 prophecies about a "],[908.04,"variety of aspects in Jesus's life and "],[910.12,"all of them came true in the fullness of "],[914.08,"time the fullness of time and the days "],[916.64,"of Mary being complete made me wonder "],[919.48,"where else this idea of child labor "],[921.8,"appears in the scripture and I have "],[924.32,"found that there's three different "],[926.04,"connotations that appear around this "],[928.64,"idea "],[929.84,"uh child birth labor can be associated "],[932.2,"with sudden judgment or pain uh it can "],[935.28,"be associated with literal child birth "],[937.52,"and or the joy that comes from that and "],[939.64,"it can also be associated with "],[941.88,"longing um I have watched my wife carry "],[945.8,"two of our children I am a man I have no "],[949.48,"experience with what that is like but I "],[951.88,"know enough to know I don't want "],[955.72,"to uh what I do know is that it is "],[959,"uncomfortable it is painful it's "],[961.4,"exhausting emotionally draining and when "],[963.6,"the lb PS come they're sudden and they "],[967.96,"hurt and to illustrate this judgment "],[970.92,"here are some verses Matthew 24: "],[973.6,"7-8 Nation will rise against Nation the "],[976,"kingdom against Kingdom there will be "],[977.84,"famines and earthquakes in various "],[979.2,"places all these are the beginning of "],[981.64,"birth "],[983.64,"pains 1 Thessalonians 5:3 while people "],[986.76,"are saying peace and safety destruction "],[988.76,"will will come on them suddenly as labor "],[990.64,"pains on a pregnant woman and they will "],[992.28,"not "],[993.24,"Escape Isaiah 138 Terror will seize them "],[997,"pain and anguish will grip them they "],[998.56,"will rise like a woman in labor they "],[1000.52,"will look a gast at each other their "],[1002.36,"faces a flame so I think we can all "],[1005.2,"agree child birth is incredibly painful "],[1007.88,"right but the joy that the child brings "],[1010.24,"when it finally "],[1011.52,"arrives is overwhelming when everything "],[1014.52,"is said and done and the screaming stops "],[1017.76,"and the smile they and they just smile "],[1019.84,"and they just look at you I remember "],[1022.48,"when I held my daughters for the first "],[1024,"time I knew for a fact I would do "],[1026.44,"anything for them with questionable "],[1031.56,"legality "],[1033.96,"and you almost forget what it took to "],[1036.4,"get them "],[1037.88,"there and you see this idea of the joy "],[1040.84,"when it comes to people like Mary you "],[1042.88,"see it with Hannah back in the Old "],[1044.6,"Testament with the mother of Samuel you "],[1046.8,"see it with Sarah the the mother of "],[1048.28,"Isaac you see with Elizabeth the mother "],[1050.24,"of John the "],[1051.56,"Baptist and maybe other women that I've "],[1055,"missed who prayed to God to give them a "],[1056.92,"child and He blesses them with "],[1059.44,"one I also know that the last month of "],[1062.48,"pregnancy can be the worst because the "],[1065.12,"time is near but it's not quite there "],[1068.04,"you just long to be done with it you can "],[1071,"see the signs you can feel the baby "],[1072.96,"wedged up in your ribs and you see you "],[1075.8,"know the day is coming and you just "],[1077.28,"really want it to arrive "],[1079.68,"Romans 8: 22:24 we know the whole "],[1082.16,"creation has been groaning as in the "],[1083.84,"Pains of child birth right up to the "],[1085.24,"present time not only so we ourselves "],[1087.96,"who have the first fruits of the spirit "],[1089.4,"Gran inwardly as we wait eagerly for our "],[1092.04,"adoption to sunship the Redemption of "],[1093.84,"our "],[1094.56,"bodies so all these ideas I'm not just "],[1096.92,"pulling up a r of random things I "],[1098.32,"promise it's all connected all these "],[1100.16,"ideas that we started with God's timing "],[1103.16,"and the anticipation of his fulfilled "],[1106.36,"promises there is something you should "],[1108.44,"know "],[1109.96,"about God's "],[1111.76,"purpose when he says he's going to do "],[1115.32,"something no one is going to stop "],[1119.12,"him Isaiah "],[1121.48,"14:27 for the Lo Lord of hosts has "],[1124.32,"purposed and who will anull it his hand "],[1127.28,"is stretched out and who will turn it "],[1130.4,"back 2 Chronicles 26 oh Lord God of our "],[1134.56,"fathers are you not God in heaven and do "],[1136.6,"you not rule over all the kingdoms of "],[1138.56,"the Nations and in your hand is there "],[1141,"not power and might so that no one is "],[1143.12,"able to withstand "],[1146.52,"you it was God's purpose that Jesus was "],[1149.76,"going to be born where he was and when "],[1153.16,"he was regardless of anything else "],[1156.72,"regardless of Herod regardless of "],[1158.92,"politicians regardless of geographical "],[1161.2,"location or full "],[1163.36,"ends Jesus was born at the right time in "],[1167.48,"Bethlehem and we think about "],[1170.52,"timing sometimes we can get or God's "],[1173.16,"timing in particular sometimes we can "],[1174.6,"get lost in the thoughts of our our own "],[1177.24,"struggles or our own situations that we "],[1179.96,"feel have gone on for too long you know "],[1183,"you I'm sick and I can't get better my "],[1185.72,"marriage is falling apart my family "],[1187.68,"members can't get along my finances are "],[1189.52,"a wreck I can't get a promotion I can't "],[1191.56,"get past this addiction where is God "],[1194.44,"where is his perfect timing cuz I'm "],[1196.84,"feeling like his timing's left me behind "],[1202.88,"sometimes those hurts are "],[1204.56,"valid and I want you to know that "],[1207.12,"sometimes it is okay to be angry or "],[1210.8,"disagree with "],[1212.52,"God David did it many times in the "],[1215,"Psalms Elijah did it Moses did "],[1219,"it even Jesus asked the cup to be taken "],[1222.04,"from him but how did Jesus finish that "],[1224.88,"phrase Luke "],[1226.96,"22:42 saying father if it is your will "],[1230.36,"take this cup away from me nevertheless "],[1233.6,"not my will but your will be "],[1238.08,"done anger and disappointment with God "],[1240.64,"is acceptable at times but only for a "],[1245,"Time Faith doesn't fail and falter "],[1247.6,"because of little doubt it falters when "],[1250.12,"we walk away "],[1251.92,"entirely if we doubt or have anger with "],[1254.68,"God we need to take it back to him and "],[1257.4,"tell him honestly "],[1259.4,"he already knows you're not telling him "],[1261.68,"anything he doesn't know in those "],[1263.84,"moments we need to lean into God more "],[1265.92,"and understand that he understands even "],[1269.56,"when we "],[1272.4,"don't that's what faith is knowing that "],[1276.8,"God knows even when you don't or even "],[1280.2,"disagree in the short times span of my "],[1283.56,"life I have seen God show me more in the "],[1286.84,"moments where I felt that he had aband "],[1288.88,"me then I did when I had everything I "],[1292.4,"wanted I'm still kind of waiting for "],[1294.32,"that everything I wanted part "],[1296.6,"but but it's all part of God's perfect "],[1300.6,"timing a few years back uh my paternal "],[1304.04,"grandfather passed away it was actually "],[1305.8,"around this time I don't remember the "],[1307.04,"exact date around December he was sick "],[1310.24,"and none of us thought he was that "],[1313.2,"sick we saw him one week and he seemed "],[1316.36,"fine and the next week he was "],[1319.52,"gone and I remember talking to my father "],[1321.92,"about it and I don't remember the exact "],[1324.48,"conversation but the gist was this God "],[1327.36,"had answered our "],[1330.12,"prayers by making him well by bringing "],[1333.76,"him "],[1335.88,"home and papey as I called him didn't "],[1340.44,"suffer at least not for a long time he "],[1344.04,"didn't slowly Decay he went quietly and "],[1347.28,"quickly "],[1349.44,"uh my maternal grandfather died earlier "],[1351.32,"this year and that affected me much more "],[1355.72,"intensely than I assumed it would have "],[1357.52,"but um on Friday night my daughter asked "],[1360.92,"me in the car just randomly she said "],[1362.44,"Daddy why is granddaddy in "],[1365.12,"heaven and I responded because God said "],[1368.2,"it was his time to "],[1370.44,"go we feel these absences and we missed "],[1374.04,"these loved ones or we missed these "],[1375.6,"loved ones but it was God's timing to "],[1378.08,"take them "],[1379.48,"then for some reason God gives and God "],[1384,"takes and he has a reason for doing it "],[1386.68,"even when we don't "],[1388.56,"agree it is in his time and his purposes "],[1391.72,"will not be stopped however he does not "],[1394.2,"leave us in sorrow but rather tells us "],[1396.76,"of a time that is coming in the future "],[1399.24,"this idea of Jesus coming back and "],[1400.76,"making all things right is all "],[1402.24,"throughout scripture Psalm "],[1405.32,"33-5 sing praise to the Lord you Saints "],[1408,"of his give thanks at the remembrance of "],[1409.68,"His holy name for his anger is but for a "],[1411.96,"moment and his favor is for Life weeping "],[1414.56,"may endure for a night but joy comes in "],[1416.88,"the "],[1417.6,"morning 1 Corinthians 3 13:12 for now we "],[1421.64,"see only a reflection as in a mirror "],[1424.8,"then we shall see face to face no now I "],[1428.24,"know in part then I shall know fully "],[1431.24,"even as I am fully "],[1434.48,"known 2 Corinthians 4:16 and 18 "],[1438.12,"therefore we do not lose heart though "],[1440.2,"outwardly we are wasting away yet "],[1442.12,"inwardly we are being renewed day by day "],[1444.72,"for our light in momentary troubles are "],[1447.12,"achieving for us an eternal glory that "],[1449.24,"far outweighs them all so we fix our "],[1451.48,"eyes not on what is seen but what is "],[1453.52,"unseen since what is seen is temporary "],[1455.84,"but what is unseen is eternal Romans "],[1459.68,"8:18 I consider that our present "],[1462.52,"sufferings are not worth comparing with "],[1464.44,"the glory that sh that will be revealed "],[1467.28,"in US John "],[1469.32,"16:21 a woman when she is in labor has "],[1472.2,"sorrow because her hour has come but as "],[1474.6,"soon as she's given birth to the child "],[1476.08,"she no longer remembers the anguish for "],[1477.88,"joy that a human being has been born "],[1479.52,"into the world therefore you now have "],[1482.76,"sorrow but I will see you again and your "],[1484.84,"heart will rejoice and your joy will no "],[1486.64,"one will take from "],[1488,"you bringing us back around to the labor "],[1492,"idea and then contining on to 31 Jesus "],[1495.12,"answered them do you now believe indeed "],[1497.76,"the hour is yes has now come that you "],[1500.12,"will be scattered each to his own and "],[1501.68,"leave will leave me alone yet I am not "],[1503.76,"alone because the father is with me "],[1505.88,"these things I have spoken to you that "],[1507.76,"in me you may have peace in the world "],[1510.04,"you will have tribulation but be of good "],[1512,"cheer I have overcome the "],[1515.08,"world Jesus has overcome the world this "],[1518.48,"is assurance that God is providing us he "],[1522.72,"promised that he will do all that I have "],[1525.64,"mentioned he will make all things right "],[1528.16,"he he will remove pain he will bring us "],[1530.92,"into a full understanding and glorify "],[1532.76,"our bodies and he will bring us into a "],[1534.76,"greater way of weight of Glory than we "],[1536.68,"could ever "],[1537.96,"imagine we need to continue in faith but "],[1541.76,"why do we continue in faith because God "],[1544.64,"has made promises like this "],[1548.12,"before remember the handful of "],[1550.12,"prophecies we just "],[1552.28,"discussed he already did all of that and "],[1555.68,"are we going to doubt him when he tells "],[1557.12,"us what he's going to do next "],[1559.76,"his resume more than speaks for "],[1562.44,"itself it is Assurance in the clearest "],[1566.84,"form Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh "],[1571.48,"what a foretaste of Glory Divine heir of "],[1574.48,"Salvation purchase of God born of his "],[1577.64,"Spirit washed in his "],[1579.52,"blood and Peter also tells us in second "],[1582.12,"Peter "],[1583.2,"3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his "],[1587.08,"promises as some count slackness but is "],[1590.24,"Long Sing suffering towards us not "],[1592.28,"willing that any should perish that all "],[1593.72,"should come to repentance God's promises "],[1596.76,"are not slow "],[1599.6,"lacking or "],[1603.32,"slacking I had to throw this in here in "],[1605.36,"Lord of the "],[1606.6,"Rings froto at one point accuses Gandalf "],[1609.76,"of being late and if you love this at "],[1612.56,"all you you know what I'm going with "],[1613.96,"this and Gand replies a wizard is never "],[1617.24,"late nor nor is he early he arrives "],[1620.44,"precisely when he means to and it sounds "],[1623.44,"corny but that is more than true of "],[1628.08,"God and we're seeing this timing at "],[1632.28,"Christmas Christmas focuses on the "],[1634.76,"Selfless Love of God in giving his son "],[1637.64,"to us it's a time to be grateful and "],[1641.08,"look at the needs of others I've always "],[1644.28,"liked the way Charles Dickinson States "],[1645.96,"in his book A Christmas Carol this is "],[1648.56,"Scrooge's nephew "],[1650.08,"talking I am sure I have always thought "],[1652.36,"of Christmas time when it comes around "],[1653.96,"apart from the veneration due to its "],[1655.68,"sacred name and origin if anything "],[1657.36,"belonging to it can be apart from that "],[1660.36,"uh oh apart from Jesus and if you can "],[1664.04,"even separate Jesus from "],[1665.56,"Christmas as a good time a kind "],[1668.32,"forgiving charitable Pleasant time the "],[1670.36,"only time I know of in the long calendar "],[1672.52,"of the year when men and women seem by "],[1674.36,"one consent to open their shut up Hearts "],[1676.68,"freely and to think of people below them "],[1678.92,"as if they were fellow passengers to the "],[1682.36,"grave and we see that displayed here "],[1685.32,"with the warm program Sheltering the "],[1688.12,"homeless during the coldest months which "],[1691,"still needs volunteers by the "],[1694.8,"way which still needs volunteers by the "],[1701.8,"way Christmas is also a focus on the "],[1704.32,"Fulfillment of God's promises and his "],[1706.24,"great faithfulness to mankind "],[1709.6,"at just the right time in the fullness "],[1712,"of time Christ came and died for the "],[1716,"ungodly when we look at the manger we "],[1718.96,"see the beginning of the most important "],[1720.48,"event in human history we see the "],[1723.28,"perfect time and fulfillment of a "],[1725.92,"millennia of "],[1729.28,"promises Pastor mcnut has been teaching "],[1731.56,"through Revelation and he's been telling "],[1733.44,"us what God has said he's going to do "],[1735.84,"next "],[1738.64,"and while we wait for these promises I'm "],[1740.36,"not going to tell you we're not going to "],[1741.48,"have pain we are Jesus said it you will "],[1744.16,"have tribulation but I have overcome the "],[1747.88,"world we will grow tired things will get "],[1751.2,"us down but we will not be overcome "],[1754.4,"because all things are as God has timed "],[1758.48,"it so let me finish with this "],[1761.2,"question if Christ came the first time "],[1765.12,"in the fullness of time do you think he "],[1767.76,"will not "],[1768.6,"return in the fullness of "],[1771.4,"time do you think he won't come to you "],[1775.16,"when you need him in the fullness of "],[1777.84,"time will he not "],[1780.24,"come in the fullness of "],[1787.08,"time father "],[1789,"God we thank you for this time to gather "],[1791.64,"together around your word we thank you "],[1793.32,"for the blood of Christ that unites us "],[1795.84,"as a church we thank you for the symbols "],[1798.96,"of the Cross and of the manger that "],[1801.48,"display to us your Selfless "],[1804.44,"Love and shows us that you know what "],[1807,"you're doing you're not making this up "],[1808.4,"as you're going along you're not "],[1811,"just you know what's going to "],[1813.96,"happen and you have us in your hands and "],[1816.4,"you're going to take care of us and we "],[1817.76,"know without a shadow of a doubt that "],[1819.64,"you will because you've done it before "],[1821.68,"and you're going to do it "],[1823.24,"again I pray you just help us to "],[1825.68,"maintain that Assurance as we go through "],[1827.32,"our lives "],[1830.28,"and serve you with the "],[1833.24,"knowledge that all things work together "],[1835.56,"for the good of those that love God we "],[1837.92,"pray all these things in your son's holy "],[1839.16,"name amen "]]}]
